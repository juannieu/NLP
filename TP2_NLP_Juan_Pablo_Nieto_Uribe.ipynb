dynamic in the european union countries,with positive consequences in terms of social and economic development. economicevolution has led to an increase of the mobility of passengers and goods. the increase ofpassenger demand is due to the remarkable g rowth of car ﬂeet that, in the last years, has tripled. freight transport has developed thanks to the european economics andproduction systems evolution (commission of the european communities, ). on theother hand, an improvement of the transport infrastructures and services without a doubtleads to an economic development; to provide high-quality transport services can be away to ensure the beneﬁts of the common market to all the european union countries.many european countries are made up of coastal areas and islands. many coastsand islands are densely populated with high tourist activities. especially for thetourism sector transport service efﬁciency is fundamental in order to have a notabledevelopment.the current issue and full text archive of this journal is available atwww.emeraldinsight.com/1450-2194.htm emjb4,1 40 euromed journal of businessvol. no. , pp. -57qemerald group publishing limited1450-2194doi .1108/14502190910956684 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) this research is focused on calabria, which is one of the southern italian regionswith many kilometres of coast; nevertheless, tourist activities are less developed thanother italian regions. one of the main problems of calabrian tourism is linked to thetransport system, because of the geographic location towards the main tourist basins,and the deﬁciencies of transport infrastructures and services; this issue is common tomany areas of the mediterranean basin.in order to encourage calabrian tourism and make calabria an international touristdestination, the strengthening of the road, rail, sea links, and especially air link, isnecessary. in fact, many places have become tourist destinations thanks to airtransport, which makes these places easily accessible and reachable in a short traveltime. air transport is also a requisite for improving accessibility among medium-sizedand large-sized towns of the mediterranean.since the s, in the european union countries, air trafﬁc has increased by .4 percent (in passengers per km), and the plane handling quintupled. a doubling of airtrafﬁc is expected by (commission of the european communities, ). however,calabrian air trafﬁc is a very low proportion of italian air trafﬁc. in , the threecalabrian airports situated at lamezia terme, reggio calabria, and crotone, registered1.8 per cent of the national handling (25,080 ﬂights), and .6 per cent of the nationalpassenger trafﬁc (2,024,105 passengers). lamezia terme airport has the most air trafﬁcamong calabrian airports, with a passenger ﬂow of .3 per cent, and a number ofﬂights of .1 per cent (enac, ). the importance of lamezia terme airport is dueto its barycentric location in the region, and to adequate accessibility because theairport is better linked with the national and local road and rail systems than the othercalabrian airports. thanks to the considerable air trafﬁc, lamezia terme airport is a bclass airport, according to the international civil aviation organization (icao) and thecivil aeronautical administration (caa) standards, and therefore it is qualiﬁed forintercontinental ﬂights; the other calabrian airports are c class airports.the socio-economic development of calabria and particularly of the touristactivities should be supported by a strengthening of air links and by an improvementof the quality of the landside and airside services offered by the airport. service qualitycan be adequately improved by taking into account the passenger’s point-of-view interms of level of satisfaction/dissatisfaction about the services.the aim of this paper is to analyse the satisfaction/dissatisfaction of the passengersof the lamezia terme airport in order to measure the quality level of some servicesoffered by the terminal. speciﬁcally, a statistical descriptive analysis of the datacollected by means of a customer satisfaction survey is made, and an ordinal logisticregression model is proposed in order to identify some service aspects to improve.the paper begins with an introduction to the tools for measuring service quality: inthe third section the theoretical framework of the logistic regression models is reported;the fourth section is about the description of the experimental context; the ﬁfth sectiondeals with the results of the model calibration; ﬁnally, a brief conclusion is drawn.customer satisfaction measureservice quality can be deﬁned as the whole of the service/product aspects andcharacteristics on which complete satisfaction on customer needs depends (taneseet al., ). there is a strong relationship between service quality and customersatisfaction. customer satisfaction is a measure of company performances according toairportpassengersatisfaction 41 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) customer needs (hillet al., ). the measure of customer satisfaction provides aservice quality measure; customer opinion on the various service/product aspects andthe overall service/product allows service quality levels to be measured. customerjudgements are collected fromad hocexperimental surveys, well known as “customersatisfaction surveys”.there are two basic concepts at the bottom of customer satisfaction surveys: theexpectations, which represent what customers expect from the service, and theperceptions, which represents what customers receive. expectations are evaluated bythe customers through the indication of a level of importance; perceptions, instead, areevaluated by a judgement of satisfaction. customer satisfaction can be evaluated bycollecting only customer perceptions, or through the comparison between expectationsand perceptions (parasuramanet al., ).customer satisfaction surveys are sample surveys realised in order to evaluate theservice quality offered by a public or private company, by taking into account thecustomer’s point-of-view.a customer satisfaction survey is designed and realised according to some mainstages. generally, in the ﬁrst stage the objectives are deﬁned and an exploratoryresearch is effected. speciﬁcally, some preliminary data and information are collectedin order to deﬁne the survey issues. the second stage is the realisation of a preliminarysurvey in which qualitative research tools, like focus groups, are used in order to deﬁnethe service quality aspects to be analysed. in the third stage the data are collected; inthis stage the kind of interview is chosen (personal, telephone, postal, or electronicsurvey), the questionnaire is designed, and the sample is deﬁned. the fourth stageconsists of the data elaboration and result interpretation. the data collected by thesurvey are analysed by means of some statistical techniques and models providing aservice quality measure; speciﬁcally, the causes generating customersatisfaction/dissatisfaction are identiﬁed, and the strategies for improving theservice quality are deﬁned. the last stage consists in the presentation of survey results;in this stage activities and projects for service improvement are launched in order toobtain a higher level of customer satisfaction (hill et al., ). some of the statistical techniques and mathematical models providing a service quality measure aredescribed in cuomo (2000), de luca (2006), eboli and mazzulla (2008a).the various service/product aspects considered in customer satisfaction surveyscan be represented by quantitative or qualitative variables, depending on the scale ofmeasure adopted for the evaluation. according to the well-known classiﬁcationproposed by stevens (1951), the scales of measurement are generally classiﬁed innominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio or cardinal scales. variables on nominal scales arequalitative variables characterised by some categorical responses, like marital statusof people (single, married, divorced, etc.), occupation (manager, freelancer, employer,trader, labourer, etc.). in customer satisfaction surveys socio-economic characteristicsis generally observed through nominal variables. variables on ordinal scales arequalitative variables characterised by ordered categorical responses, like thejudgements for the evaluation of a service (sufﬁcient, good, very good, excellent), thelevels of family income (low, middle, high). in customer satisfaction surveys, the majorpart of the scales adopted for evaluation of service/product quality are ordinal scales.variables on interval scales are quantitative variables characterised by numericallyordered responses, from an arbitrary origin, like the temperature measure in celsius oremjb4,1 42 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) fahrenheit degrees. variables on ratio scales are quantitative variables characterisedby ordered values (positive or negative), from a point representing the absolute zerocorresponding to the nullity of the phenomenon analysed. examples of these variablesare family income, the number of employees, the person’s age. in customer satisfactionsurveys, the variables used for evaluating the service/product aspects can be cardinaldiscrete or continuous variables, and assume only positive values. there is also acategory of variables, named dichotomous variables, which assume only two values.examples of these variables are the gender (male, female), a customer judgement abouta service/product (satisﬁed, dissatisﬁed).the kinds of scale of measurement more frequently used in the customer satisfactionsurveys are the likert scale, verbal scale, simultaneous multi-attribute trade-off(simalto) scale and the numerical and ungraded scale (hill et al., ). the points on the likert scale are described by means of words, typically statements indicating thelevel of agreement/disagreement (for example the lower level is “disagree strongly” andthe higher level is “agree strongly”); therefore, the likert scale is an ordinal scale. the useof the likert scale for evaluating customer satisfaction involves generally positive bias inthe survey results; for this reason this kind of scale is not particularly adequate forcustomer satisfaction surveys (hillet al., ). the verbal scale is analogous to thelikert one, because the points are described by means of words, but the kind of words isdifferent. in fact, as an example, the points are described through simple concepts suchas “quite dissatisﬁed”, “neither satisﬁed nor dissatisﬁed”, “very satisﬁed”, and so on; thiskind of scale has the advantage of an immediate comprehensibility for the respondentsand, compared to the likert scale, it reduces the risk of respondent confusion (hill et al., ). verbal scales have some disadvantages in the stage of data analysis, because theonly statistical method convenient for the analysis is represented by frequencydistributions. also the verbal scale is an ordinal scale. simalto scales are ordinalscales characterised by full verbal descriptions of the different service aspects andsimultaneous comparisons among themselves (trade-off). this kind of scale is veryuseful for the service evaluation, because the services can be described in detail andcompared among them. on the other hand, this methodology is more complex andexpensive compared to the others (hillet al., ). the numerical scale, which is a cardinal scale, is the simplest to analyse. in order to measure customer satisfaction,discrete values can be used, from to , from to , from to , from to , etc. moredetailed results can be obtained by using a scale with a higher number of levels (forexample or levels). sometimes the adopted scale has an even number of levels, forexample from to ; this kind of scale is characterised by the absence of a central point ofequilibrium and is generally adopted when it is convenient to stimulate the intervieweetowards a non-neutral position. in other cases, the traditional numeric scholastic scale ofmeasurement is adopted; this scale is composed of points from to (tanese et al., ). the ungraded scale is a segment in which only the two extreme points areindicated, and the interviewee is asked to indicate the point reﬂecting his level ofsatisfaction with a certain service aspect.there are different tools for measuring service quality according to the differenttypes of data collected by customer satisfaction survey and the scale of measurementadopted for capturing customer judgements.the models for analysing customer satisfaction and measuring service quality can beused in order to relate the attribute representing the main service aspects to the overallairportpassengersatisfaction 43 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) service. the models more commonly reporte d in the literature are linear and logistic regression models, structural equation models (sem) (bollen, ), and logit models(domencich and mcfadden, ; ben-akiva and lerman, ). in the regression modelsthe dependent variable is represented by overall customer satisfaction and the independentvariables are the service quality attributes. by means of these models the weights of everyattributes on overall customer satisfaction can be calculated. sem permit the explorationof the relationship between overall customer satisfaction and service quality attributes. inthese models latent variables representing the unobserved and unmeasured factors areintroduced; the latent variables are linked to the observed ones representing the servicequality indicators used for measuring custom er satisfaction in public transport. logit models are discrete choice models, based on random utility theory; these models allowservice quality to be measured by considering in the utility function of each choicealternative some service characteristics. according to a more recent approach, choicealternatives represent hypothetical services deﬁned by complex experiments based on thewell-known stated preferences techniques (prioni and hensher, ).in the literature, some applications of these models were proposed for analysingcustomer satisfaction. in the ﬁeld of transport service quality, some examples of linearregression models for measuring bus service quality are reported in baltes (2003) andmorfoulaki and papaioannou (2006). some applications of sem models for evaluatingtransit service quality are reported in andreassen (1995), stuart et al.(2000), karlaftis et al.(2001), eboli and mazzulla (2007). some multinomial logit models were proposedby hensher in order to measure the quality level of a bus service (hensher and prioni,2002); hierarchical logit models were introduced by hensher et al.(2003), and marcucci and gatta (2007); mixed logit models were introduced by hensher (2001), and eboli andmazzulla (2008b). in these models each alternative is a bus service characterised bysome service quality attributes. in gkritzaaet al.(2006) a multinomial logit with three possible discrete outcomes (unsatisﬁed, indifferent and satisﬁed) was proposed inorder to analyse airport security screening according to passenger experience.ordinal logistic regressionlogistic regression is a regression method applied when the dependent variableyis dichotomous. therefore, the method of regressi on function estimation joins the probability that the response takes the value of with a set of explanatory variables (fabbris, ).the explanatory variablesx kcan be dichotomous, nominal, ordinal or quantitative.while in the linear regression the estimation of the yvariable has value between21andþ1, in the logistic regression the estimation ofyvaries between and , and assumes the meaning of probability thatytakes the value of as a function of the explanatory variablesx k.when the variables are of a qualitative nature, the bkcoefﬁcients are estimated by the maximum likelihood method, which provides the parameter values maximising theprobability of observing the experimental data set.the parameter statistical signiﬁcance is usually veriﬁed by the wald test, accordingto the null hypothesis (h 0) that a bkcoefﬁcient is equal to zero (h :bk¼0):w¼ bmlk/c0/c1var bmlk/c0/c1/c2/c3 =2ð1þemjb4,1 44 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) sometimes the wald test is replaced by the wald chi-square test, distributed accordingto a x2distribution.the goodness-of-ﬁt of the model is generally veriﬁed by means of the nagelkerker 2test; ther2is between and , and assumes a low value if the model is unable toreplicate the observed data:r n¼r2cs 12l0ðþ2=nð2þ in which:r cs¼12l0ðþl bml/c0/c1\"#2=n ð3þsome extensions of the logistic regression method allow a categorical variable yto be considered. the best-known methods have been developed for ordinal responsevariables. these models are deﬁned as ordinal logistic regression (olr) models; themost well-known of these models is called the proportional odds model (pom).the olr model estimates the effects of a set of independent variables (numerical orcategorical) on the logarithm of the probability that the dependent variable assumeslow values rather than high values (cainarca and sgobbi, ). if the ordinaldependent variable assumesjdistinct values, the relationship with thex kindependent variables can be expressed through the following formula:log py#jjx/c0/c1py.jjx/c0/c1\"#¼aj2xkk¼1 bkxk¼aþxb ð4þforjvarying between andj-1, where ajare the intercepts indicating the probabilitythatyvariable assumes low values rather than high values in case of nullity of all theindependent variables, and bkrepresents the log(odds) change corresponding to a unitary increase of thex kvariables; positive values of the bkcoefﬁcients correspond to higher probabilities that the dependent variable assumes high values, and vice versa.the pom model is attractive for dependent variables whose ordinality can be seenas being based on an underlying continuous dimension, probably unobserved. thebasic idea underlying the pom model is re-expressing the categorical variable in termsof a number of binary variables according to the adopted ordinal scale; as an example,ifyvariable is expressed according to an ordinal scale with points, there are threecorresponding binary variables (y c, with c¼1;...;3), so that, a value of is assigned to each variable, in the presence of the categorical attribute, and a value of otherwise.in this way three logistic binary models are considered, each of which corresponds tothe regression of eachy cvariable separately against the same explanatory variablesx k. according to the pom model, the vector of the bparameters is the same for all the three models, so that the only difference among the models is given by the intercept ac. logistic regression models, and particularly olr models, are very suitable forcustomer satisfaction analysis, because surveys are generally conducted by usingordinal verbal scales of measurement (eboli and mazzulla, a).airportpassengersatisfaction 45 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) in order to analyse customer satisfaction data, the qualitative points on the ordinalscale are usually changed into numerical values. the transformation can be made bymeans of methods of direct or indirect determinate quantiﬁcation. in the ﬁrst case,conventional equidistant numbers are directly assigned to each qualitative point,according to the hypothesis that these points have the same distance from a semanticpoint-of-view. in the second case, non-equidistant numbers are assigned to eachqualitative point, so that distances more similar to the judgement expressed by thecustomers correspond to the values of the number differences. the methodologies ofindirect determinate quantiﬁcation more frequently reported in the literature are themethods of transformation of the ordinal points, based on optimal scaling techniques,or the decomposition methods, for which preliminary transformations of thejudgements are not necessary (de luca, ).logistic regression models have been mainly applied in the sector of social sciences(gay, ; istituto per la ricerca sociale, ; casacchia and natale, ), economics(cainarca and sgobbi, ), and medicine (tutz and scholtz, ). there are alsosome applications for describing customer satisfaction (mihelis et al., ; siskoset al., ; tennessee department of human services, ; lawson and montgomery,2006).experimental contextthe experimental context relates to the services offered by the terminal of lameziaterme airport. the passenger terminal is a key point for passenger transfer, from thelandside to the airside; the terminal services have the double purpose of satisfying thecustomers demand and producing proﬁts for the company managing the airport.usually, the main services of a terminal can be distinguished in services related toincoming passengers and to departing passengers, and other services related to thestructures serving the passengers waiting in the terminal. in this context servicequality was analysed by using the data collected by a sample survey addressed to thepassengers departing from the airport.the survey was realised in december by the company managing the airportservices (societa`aeroportuale calabrese, sa.cal.), on the occasion of the medairproject developed for the interreg ii c european programme drawn up by thedepartment of land use planning of the university of calabria; more detailedinformation about the survey are included in the medair project ﬁnal report (d’eliaet al., ). in the airport registered a plane handling of ,600 and a number ofpassengers of ,000 passengers per year, departing and incoming.the aim of the questionnaire was the description of the passenger trips in terms oforigin, destination, frequency and purpose of the ﬂight, and the measurement of servicequality in terms of accessibility to the airport, air links, and passenger terminalservices. the questionnaire, including multiple choice questions, was addressed to asample of about ,800 passengers; at the time of the survey there were about ,000passengers leaving the airport, and therefore the sample rate is per cent. the ﬁrstsection of the questionnaire includes questions about socio-economic characteristics ofthe passengers interviewed, like sex, age, place of residence, occupation. in the secondsection some questions about the travel habits were asked (transport mode to reach theairport, travel purpose, early arrival time before the boarding, etc.). the third section ofthe questionnaire includes some questions about quality of some services available inemjb4,1 46 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) the passenger terminal. a passenger judgement about the following service qualityaspects was asked: .competence of personnel; .helpfulness of personnel; .airport appearance; .road condition inside the airport; .airport signposting; .security against thefts; .cleanliness inside the terminal; .toilets inside the terminal; .video information inside the terminal; .air-conditioning inside the terminal; .luggage trolley availability inside the airport; .availability and frequency of bus links; and .public telephone availability inside the terminal; and car rental.the interviewed passengers gave a judgement to each service aspect according to anordinal verbal scale varying on six levels, which are “very poor”, “poor”, “insufﬁcient”,“sufﬁcient”, “good”, and “very good”. in addition, a judgement on overall service wasasked of the passengers according to the same verbal scale. the last section of thequestionnaire includes some questions about passenger use of some business structuresinside the airport, like bar, shops, self-service restaurant. speciﬁcally, the passengers gavea judgement on the following aspects: product range, product availability, productquality, product prices, shop layout, kindness of personnel, service times to the customers.all these aspects were evaluated according to the verbal scale described above.a statistical descriptive analysis of the sample was carried out by using someinformation requested of the passengers interviewed. the sample was spread over percent male and percent female respondents. a total of per cent of the sample isaged between and ; only per cent of the sample is younger than years; percent is older than years. the place of residence of per cent of the respondents is italy,and per cent of which is resident in calabria. a total of per cent of the sample isfreelancer or businessman, and employee or teacher; per cent of the respondents is manager/ofﬁcer; per cent are students or pensioners. the major part of the passengersinterviewed are occasional customers; in fact, about out of ,800 passengers made lessthan ﬂights every year, or rather less than one ﬂight every month. only passengerscan be considered regular customers, because they make more than ﬂights every year,or rather at least two ﬂights every week; the rest of the passengers make between and100 ﬂights per year, with an average frequency of about ﬂights per year.over per cent of the sample travels for work purposes, per cent for tourism,and the rest of the passengers for other purposes. a total of per cent arrives at theairport less than one hour ahead the boarding, while the rest of the passengersinterviewed arrived more than one hour early. a total of per cent of the samplewould use the airport more frequently if there was a higher number of ﬂights and airlinks with further destinations.airportpassengersatisfaction 47 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) service quality statistical data analysisfor each service aspect, absolute and relative frequency distributions were calculated,referred to each point of the ordinal scale. frequency distributions are useful foranalysing qualitative data because for this kind of data cannot be applied the statisticaltechniques adopted for analysing quantitative data. frequency distributions areadopted for analysing customer satisfaction data because customer judgements areusually expressed according to ordinal verbal scales.the relative frequency distribution is more convenient than the absolutedistribution because it allows many d ata sets with different numbers of observations to be compared, owing to a base equal to or (table i).the frequency distribution is very similar for all the service aspects analysed(figure ). the judgement most frequently expressed by the passengers interviewed is“good”, followed by “very good”. therefore, we can say that the passengers aresatisﬁed on the whole with the services offered by the terminal.the analysis of the relative frequency distributions conﬁrms that for all the serviceaspects the judgement more frequently expressed by the passengers is “good”, andparticularly for the service aspect linked to the competence and helpfulness ofpersonnel, and to the road condition inside the airport.the proposed modelcustomer satisfaction data collected by the survey addressed to the passengersdeparting from lamezia terme airport, were used for calibrating a regression model inwhich the independent variables are the judgements on service aspects offered by theterminal, and the dependent variable is the overall satisfaction.because of the ordinal polytomous nature of the dependent and independentvariables, the ordinal regression analysis was adopted in order to estimate the weightof the service aspects on the overall satisfaction. speciﬁcally, an olr model wasformulated and calibrated in order to estimate the effects of some independentvariables on the logarithm of the probability that the dependent variable assumes lowvalues rather than high values. in order to analyse the data, a numerical code (from to ) was assigned to each point on the ordinal scale, according to the methodologyknown as direct determined quantiﬁcation (de luca, ). speciﬁcally, a value equalto was assigned to “very poor” judgement, and a value of to “very good” judgement.in the proposed model the dependent variable is named as “satisfaction”, while theindependent variables represent the service aspects described previously. thefrequency of observed cases shows that the numerousness of some points of thejudgements expressed for the different service aspects, is very small. this factgenerally leads to estimations of coefﬁcients not statistically valid. in fact, the dataanalysis reported in table i shows a preponderance of “sufﬁcient”, “good” and “verygood” points. this fact was conﬁrmed by the model preparatory calibration results;therefore, two models were calibrated: a ﬁrst model (extended model), in which thereare all the regression coefﬁcient, and a second model (reduced model) in which the notstatistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients were removed. the model results are reported intable ii. the model calibrations were effected by means of the spss statisticalsoftware (version .0), modelling the ordinal regression through the plum procedure(polytomous universal model procedure). the models were calibrated by using observations.emjb4,1 48 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) very poor poor insufﬁcient sufﬁcient good very goodabsolute relative absolute relative

explanatorypower, in fact the statistics lr are widely veriﬁed, and the values of r2of nagelkerke are near the unit (0.958 for the extended model, and .948 for the reduced model).the comparison between the extended and reduced model showed an insigniﬁcantimpact of some services aspects on the passenger overall satisfaction, and particularly,the services linked to the helpfulness of personnel, airport appearance, airportsignposting, toilets inside the terminal, and availability and frequency of bus links.the key to the reading of this results can be searched in the low correlation betweenthe judgements expressed on some service aspects and the judgements on the overallservice. almost all the coefﬁcients of the statistically signiﬁcant variables have anegative sign and decrease in absolute value; this fact indicates that the contribution tothe overall dissatisfaction decreases when the variables assume higher values, orrather when the passengers are more satisﬁed with the single service aspect. also thecoefﬁcient linked to the availability of luggage trolleys has a decreasing negativevalue, but only for the higher judgement points on the scale; in fact, the coefﬁcientsrelating to “very poor” and “poor” points have lower absolute values but are notstatistically signiﬁcant. two exceptions are: the coefﬁcient linked to the securityagainst thefts,

positive values for all thepoints except the ﬁrst point.the proposed model can be considered as six distinct models of customersatisfaction corresponding to the six values linked to the points adopted for thecustomer judgements. each model identiﬁes a market segment characterised by thestated level of satisfaction.conclusive discussionlogistic regression is a ﬂexible statistical modelling technique that provides a usefultool for analysing response data and establishing relationships between binary ormulti-level categorical variables, that are not continuous and normally distributed.the aim of this research was to show how logistic regression models can be appliedto the customer satisfaction assessment process, which is a business processcommonly chosen by many companies. in fact, customer satisfaction data are typicallynot continuously distributed and are often categorical. these models provide to thecompanies a way for identifying the actions to improve their relationships withcustomers.in this paper an ordinal logistic regression model for measuring air passengersatisfaction has been introduced. the proposed model can be considered as aconsumer-based method, because it requires input data collected by an experimentalsurvey through a simple questionnaire. customer judgments are collected by using anordinal qualitative satisfaction scale, which allows the judgments to be immediatelyexpressed.according to the various level of satisfaction different customer proﬁles can bedetermined. in fact, by using the coefﬁcients of each model, the company managing theairport services can identify the actions for improving passenger satisfaction and thenservice quality. in this way a market segment can be transferred from a lowsatisfaction level to a high level.the current model has some limitations. the robustness of data should be veriﬁedand the model should be tested by using alternative and more current data sets.further analysis could be performed by using other variables to verify the effects ofadditional insights on the customer satisfaction assessment process. as an example,customer satisfaction with check-in and check-out services could be investigated. inaddition, the models should be diversiﬁed on the basis of socio-economic passengercharacteristics in order to verify how passenger preferences change according to themarket segments; analogously, travel purpose could be considered. at this stage, theavailable data did not allow these analyses. therefore, the model can not be used “asis” to make decisions with regards to service provision at strategic level and forplanning adequately the actions of service improvement. however, the model proposedcan be used for identifying the level combinations among the service aspects whichgive a desired value of overall satisfaction.by comparing the introduced model with the other models adopted for measuringcustomer satisfaction, we can say that the model has some advantages. the datausually adopted for customer satisfaction survey are expressed according to verbalscales, and particularly ordinal scales. the ordinal logistic regression model is the mostsuitable for analysing these types of data. on the contrary, logit models generallyemjb4,1 54 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :50 january (pt) adopt choice data; in this case the choice alternatives are deﬁned by complexexperiments. the use of this type of data presumes a survey designed ad hoc. in the same way, sem are characterised by complex structures, and the data adopted must becontinuous; if qualitative data are available only, a preliminary data transformation isnecessary in order to calibrate sem coefﬁcients. in the case of ordinal regression thequalitative data collected by the customer satisfaction survey can be used after asimple code transformation. as an example we adopted a transformation known asdirect determined quantiﬁcation.a comparison between the variables introduced in the proposed model and thevariables generally considered for measuring transport service quality, can not beeasily effected, because the variables introduced in the model refer to airport terminalservices.future research could be directed to the examination of the links between measuresof the performance of the company managing the airport services and results of themodel concerning satisfaction for the air passengers. referencesandreassen, t.w.

traveling through u.s. airports is increasing because of the proliferation of longer-range aircraft, expanding global alliances, and a growing middle class from developing nations. each international airport has a unique design, and many inter - national travelers experience difficulty finding their way in unfamiliar airports. the wayfinding task is made more difficult when combined with other factors such as traveler anxiety, jet lag, and unfamiliarity with the local language and culture. to understand better the chal-lenges faced by international travelers, a literature review, a human factors task analysis, and an international traveler intercept survey were carried out to determine traveler needs, expectations, and key factors that affect traveler satisfaction with an airport. four traveler surveys were developed and administered to different traveler groups. surveys were administered at the eight u.s. gateway airports with the most international travelers. some key findings were as follows: (a) all traveler groups identified easy wayfinding as being the most important airport feature, with travelers transferring between two flights rating it highest; (b) in comparison to other traveler groups, arriving travelers rated short walking distance as being much more important than other features; (c) travelers making a connection between two international flights did not expect that they would need to collect and recheck their bags while in transit; (d) travelers making a connection between two international flights had the lowest overall satisfaction as compared with the other traveler groups; and (e) only one-third of travelers making a connection between two international flights had a positive experience with the walking distance between flights. in response to the continuing increase of international travelers traveling through u.s. airports and the difficulty many international travelers experience moving around u.s. airports, trb’s acrp sponsored a research project to develop guidelines to assist airports in making improvements to the international traveler experience (1 ). this paper summarizes the human factors component of this research. the objective of this research was to identify the key elements of the international traveler experience that most influence satisfaction. the scope of work included a literature review of the physiological and cognitive factors that affect international travelers, a task analysis of the essential activities of international travelers at u.s. airports, and the development and analysis of an international traveler survey to measure the expectations of international travelers, as well as their perceptions of the relative importance of key airport features and their satisfaction with these features.human factors affecting the traveler experiencehuman factors is the scientific discipline concerned with the under - standing of interactions among humans and other elements of a sys-tem to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. human factors research, also referred to as ergonomics, examines how people interact with various aspects of the world and aims to make these interactions safer, healthier, and more efficient.various factors that affect the traveler experience include1. expectations.2. travel anxiety.3. jet lag and travel fatigue.4. differences in language and culture.5. building complexity.6. information overload.7. getting lost.expectationsair travelers want airports to be well organized with clear signage and to have essential facilities, such as restrooms, concessions, and restaurants. each airport is unique, and even though the same essen-tial processes are carried out—check-in, security checkpoint, and border protection—there may be subtle but significant differences that may be unexpected.travelers anticipate what they will encounter at a new place based on their prior experiences. even before arriving, travelers visualize themselves in that setting based on their expectations. if the new place is similar to places they have already visited, they will have an easier time adjusting; the more different the new place is, the more difficult it will be for travelers to cope with their environment (2).travel anxietyone in three americans experiences a fear of flying (3 ). these customers make two-thirds fewer trips by air than those who are not afraid (3). although nearly half of traveler anxiety is experienced during takeoff and landing, about one-third who experience air travel anxiety identified customs and baggage claim processes as the source of their anxiety (4). faa reports that medical emergencies are gen-erally caused by stresses related to flight delays, inspection by u.s. customs and border protection (cbp), security clearance, and baggage handling (4). overall, airport physicians believe that the airport segment of travel may be more hazardous than the in-flight segment (4).airport features most likely to affect international traveler satisfaction thomas smahel human factors north, inc., spadina avenue, toronto, ontario m5t c2, canada. tsmahel@hfn.ca.smahel as would be expected, there is an effect of culture on perceived travel risk; data collected from over travelers found that tourists from the united states, hong kong, and australia perceived more travel risk, felt less safe, and were more anxious than tourists from canada, the united kingdom, and greece (5 ). a turkish study found an effect of culture on user anxiety at security checkpoints; muslim and african travelers experienced higher anxiety levels than euro-pean travelers (6). security screening and border protection pro-cesses often create the most stress for customers, while postsecurity concession areas and gate hold rooms provide the most stress relief (7). baggage claim is another area of stress as customers worry if their baggage will be delivered or if it was lost by the airline (4).customer uncertainty about what information they need or what the next step in the process entails significantly influences the amount of stress customers experience. flight delays are another major source of anxiety for customers as they may disrupt other parts of their travel itinerary. some customers have anxiety about being in an unfamiliar airport environment (8) and may have a stressful or enjoyable experience depending on the effectiveness of the way-finding system (9). transfers between trains are a main cause of anxiety in rail travel; therefore, transfers between flights would also be expected to be a main cause of anxiety in air travel (10).jet lag and travel fatiguelong-haul international travelers arriving or making a connection at a u.s. airport will have likely spent from to h on an overseas flight spanning multiple time zones. long-haul travel affects travelers’ ability to function normally and causes them to experience jet lag. jet lag causes travelers to feel tired and disoriented, decreasing their ability to concentrate and carry out the physical and mental tasks essential to wayfinding in large environments, such as airports (11).differences in language and cultureinternational travelers may experience culture shock caused by a language barrier, a lack of understanding of local technology, and information overload (12). a wayfinding study of tourists not famil-iar with the local language found that level of anxiety was correlated with negative wayfinding performance (13).building complexitylarge airports have many gates that are often distributed in sev-eral buildings. research shows that decision points that require a change in level make it more difficult for customers to find their way as compared with decision points on the same level (14). this additional difficulty results from the need to reorient oneself follow-ing the change in level, especially if one needs to turn around after changing levels.information overloadwhen carrying out a task such as finding one’s way in an airport, customers are continuously perceiving their environment (e.g., sight and sounds), mentally interpreting this information, and then making decisions based on the task at hand. there are numerous junctions within an airport where a number of destination options are presented to travelers. because of limitations in human information processing, performing one task at a time results in the best performance (15). when facing high workload, people are more likely to experience stress and to make mistakes (16).getting lostaccording to the survey results, the most important feature of an airport is ease of finding one’s way inside the airport. when people get lost or have difficulty finding their way, the common emotional response is as follows (17): first, people blame themselves for not being able to understand their environment. second, they feel frus-trated because they are lost and anxious, and being lost may cause them delay or to miss their flight. third, people may feel anger or resentment that such a simple and obvious task should be so difficult to carry out.airport user categoriesbefore considering the tasks travelers must carry out during air travel, it is important to consider the different categories of airport users to understand their expectations and their potential limitations. some of the ways airport users may be categorized include the following:• purpose of trip. travelers may travel for business or leisure.• frequency of travel. international travelers may travel to a particular airport very often, occasionally, or it may be their first time visiting that airport or an airport of that size.• special needs. some travelers may require greater assistance, including families with small children, elderly persons, or per - sons with sensory or mobility impairments. issues related to the impacts of aging travelers on airport design are addressed in acrp synthesis (18).• journey segment. on a given trip travelers are likely to experi-ence specific areas of the airport depending on whether they are departing, arriving, or making a connection.• travelers and nontravelers. to provide assistance to travelers, a subset of airport visitors accompanies departing travelers or greets arriving travelers.traveler task analysis by journey segmenta task analysis was carried out to identify the individual components of a traveler’s journey through an airport depending on whether the traveler was departing on an international flight, arriving on an international flight, or making a connection between two flights with at least one of those being an international flight. in addition, the factors that might contribute to traveler satisfaction were identified for each task.international departing travelersthe key functions and activities of the international departures process include the following tasks:• pretrip planning. travelers prepare themselves for their journey by packing their baggage in accordance with baggage allowances, transportation research record organizing their travel documents, determining what time they need to arrive at the airport, choosing what mode of transportation they will use to get to the airport, and deciding what area of the airport they will need to use to enter the airport. in a previous unpublished traveler survey at a major u.s. airport (2012), it was determined that approximately one in three (30%) international travelers did not know which terminal to access for their departing flight.• journey to the airport. there are numerous mode choices for get-ting to the airport, such as private car, hired car, public transportation, shuttle bus, taxi, limousine, and rental car.• airport roadway access. for travelers driving a traveler vehicle to the airport, the roadway signage is an essential component of their journey to ensure they navigate to the intended area of the airport, which could be the correct terminal, the selected parking lot, or rental car return. getting to the airport can be a time-sensitive event, and travelers who get lost or go to the wrong part of the airport may miss their flight. for more information on airport wayfinding and signing guidelines, see acrp report (19).• ticketing and check-in. ticketing and check-in options (e.g., self-serve and full serve) may be different in the united states as compared with airports in other areas of the world.• security screening. depending on the airport, there may be multiple security screening locations with different wait times asso-ciated with each location. the screening process may also vary from airport to airport with respect to the specific requirements of the screening process (e.g., liquids and removal of specific articles or clothing such as shoes, belts, and jackets).• postsecurity concessions and amenities. once travelers enter the secure area of the airport—and while they wait for their flight—they may wish to access amenities such as restrooms, restaurants, airport lounges, business lounges, and shopping areas. information booths are also an important facility in this area to assist travelers who are experiencing difficulty locating the product or service for which they are looking.• departure gate. travelers waiting to board their flight may wish to spend their time in the waiting area next to the departure gate.international arriving travelersthe key functions and activities of the international arrivals process include the following:• international arrivals corridor. after alighting from the plane, international travelers are directed to follow a corridor that takes them directly to passport control. depending on the gate location, travelers may have a long walk to passport control.• passport control. passport control is located at the end of the international arrivals corridor. travelers are required to sort them-selves into the correct queue that corresponds with their travel documents.• international baggage claim. after passport control, travelers proceed to the international baggage claim area. they are required to determine which carousel is associated with their flight and then locate the carousel within the baggage claim hall.• exit from customs and border control. after they have collected their baggage, travelers are required to proceed to the baggage claim exit where they are required to present their travel documents.• arrivals hall. the arrivals hall is often a much larger space than the cbp area. travelers may be faced with a large number of people waiting to meet and greet the international arriving travelers, which can be overwhelming.• ground transportation. the curbside area is generally where ground transportation options can be found. depending on the airport there may be numerous transportation options available, including taxis, limousines, public transportation, and hotel shuttles.• airport roadway egress. for those travelers who are driving their own vehicle or a rental car from the airport, the roadway signage is an essential component of their journey to ensure they head out in the right direction to their final destination. for more infor mation on airport wayfinding and signing guidelines, see acrp report (19).international connecting travelersan international traveler can make a connection at a u.s. airport in three ways: international arrival to domestic departure, international arrival to international departure, and domestic arrival to international departure.international arrival to domestic departuremany international travelers who arrive at u.s. airports are connecting to domestic flights to reach their final destination. for these travelers the sequence of tasks includes all the tasks of the international arriving travelers (see above), as well as the following:• baggage recheck. after exiting cbp travelers are required to recheck their bags. this involves travelers locating the proper baggage drop-off location.• determining location of departing flight. domestic flights are usually located in a different area of the airport, sometimes in a different building. travelers often are required to use flight infor - mation displays to determine which gate is associated with their departing domestic flight.• domestic flight terminal access (if applicable). after determin-ing the departure gate for their departing domestic flight, travelers must determine how to get there. in some cases there is more than one way to travel between terminals (e.g., walk or take an air train or shuttle bus).domestic arrival to international departurefor those travelers arriving on a domestic flight and connecting to an international flight, the series of tasks is similar to those carried out by international departing travelers except the domestic flight is their method of transportation to the airport, and upon arrival they must determine the location of the departing international flight and determine the best way to get there.international arrival to international departurea small proportion of travelers arriving on an international flight to the united states connect to a second international flight. the connection process is very different from that in other countries. in most other countries these connecting travelers are only required to go through a security check and passport control before proceeding smahel to the gate for their connecting flight. in the united states these travelers are required to collect their baggage as part of the cbp process and then recheck their baggage before proceeding to their connecting flight.traveler surveysurvey designthe primary purpose of the traveler survey was to determine (a) the airport features that are most important to international travelers and (b) traveler satisfaction with these airport features. the intent of the survey was to intercept international travelers at various parts of the airport to capture their experience as departing travelers, arriv-ing travelers, or travelers making a connection between two flights. a unique set of questions was given to travelers who were in the process of experiencing each of these journey segments. the survey was carried out between november and april . the duration of the survey was to min.survey administrationthe survey was carried out at eight large u.s. airports. the survey was available in languages, and the primary method of delivery was a tablet computer. opportunities to stop travelers to invite them to participate in a survey were limited. in most areas of the airport, travelers are focused on getting to where they need to go or prepar - ing to engage in an airport process such as waiting in line at security, check-in, concessions, or passport control. the research team did not want to interfere with any of these activities.two areas of the airport were identified as suitable locations to approach travelers to participate in the survey. the first location was the departure waiting areas. travelers here are likely to have free time to fill out a survey as they wait for their departing flight. the second location was the baggage claim hall.in the departures area, the survey was administered during the time of day with the greatest number of international flights to a range of destinations, including europe, asia, and south america. one or two members of the research team would visit each depar - ture gate and approach random persons who did not appear to be busy. the researcher showed the tablet computer to individual trav-elers. the tablet computer showed a written invitation, displayed in languages, to participate in the survey (figure ). if travelers indicated yes, the researcher handed them the tablet, and the travel-ers filled out the survey on their own in one of the available lan-guages. when they were finished they handed the tablet back to the researcher and the process was repeated. no more than surveys were administered at a given departure gate.the survey administration in the departure areas of the terminal had a response rate of approximately % to %. by comparison, the response rate in the baggage claim area was less than %.in an attempt to capture a greater proportion of arriving travelers, invitation cards were printed and distributed in the arrivals hall. travelers who accepted the invitation card (figure ) were given instructions for where to fill out the survey online at a convenient time. the response to the invitation cards was less than %. the total sample size was surveys with at least at each of the eight large airports. figure greeting screen on tablet computer. figure survey invitation card (top = front, bottom = back).38 transportation research record survey resultstraveler demographicslanguagethe survey was carried out in languages, with % of the surveys carried out in english and the remaining % conducted in other languages. the most common foreign languages were spanish (7%), japanese (5%), french (4%), chinese (4%), and korean (4%).for those respondents who filled out the survey in a language other than english (n = ), % said they could read the signage in english at the airport, % said they could only read a little english, and % said they could not read any english.trip purposeoverall, most of the respondents were traveling for personal reasons (81%) as opposed to business (19%).age and gender distributionmore than half of those surveyed were male (56%), and a little less than half were female (44%). the age distribution was as follows: % were less than years of age, % were between the ages of and , and % were over years of age.travel frequencyabout half of those surveyed (54%) were infrequent international travelers, having only been on one or two international flights in the past year (including the flight in question).country of residenceabout half of the travelers surveyed currently lived in the united states (53%), and half lived outside the united states (47%).surveys completed by journey segmentthe portion of the trip on which respondents were surveyed is summarized as follows: % were departing on an international flight, % were making a connection between a domestic flight and an international flight, % were making a connection between two international flights, and % had just arrived on an international flight.effect of trip segment on overall airport satisfactiontravelers were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the air - port on a five-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor). a chi-square test determined that significantly fewer travelers making an international-to-international connection had a positive experience (55% said the experience was excellent or very good) as compared with travelers departing (76%), arriving (77%), or making a domestic-to-international (71%) connection ( p < .001) (figure ).effect of trip segment on satisfaction with main airport featuresfor each trip segment survey, travelers were asked to rate the satis-faction with key processes (i.e., check-in, security checkpoint, and cbp) and related activities (i.e., walking distances, waiting times, ease of wayfinding tasks, and staff helpfulness) on a five-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor) (table ). travelers were more likely to have a positive experience• at security checkpoints as a departing traveler (69% said their experience was excellent or very good) as compared with a connecting traveler (40% and %),• at cbp as an arriving traveler (58%) as compared with a connecting traveler (48%),• with walking distances

featuresrespondents were asked to rate how important various airport features were at any airport. ratings were made using a three-point scale (very important, somewhat important, or not important). over - all, the most important airport feature was ease of finding their way in the airport (82% said this feature was very important), and the least important feature was shopping and restaurants (36%) (table ). departing travelers indicated that helpful staff was the most impor - tant feature (81%), connecting travelers indicated that ease of finding their way was most important (86% and %), and arriving travelers indicated that short lines at security was most important (85%).respondents were subsequently asked—based on their experience that day at that airport—to rate their satisfaction with each of these airport features on a five-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor). overall, travelers were most likely to have had a posi-tive experience with the cleanliness of the airport (75%) and least likely to have had a positive experience with internet access (50%) (table ). arriving travelers were most likely to have a positive experience with helpful staff (71%). departing (76%) and connecting (64% and %) travelers were most likely to have a positive experi-ence with airport cleanliness. only one-third of travelers making an international-to-international connection had a positive experience with the walking distance between flights.a comparison was made between ratings of the perceived impor - tance of and the observed satisfaction with the main airport features (figure ). airport features that were judged to be very important but received lower satisfaction scores included short lines at security, short lines at customs, and the availability of free wi-fi. interestingly, short walking distance was not judged to be very important overall; it was rated only slightly more important than the least important feature, shopping and restaurants.traveler expectationsnearly travelers surveyed had arrived on an international flight and were waiting to depart on a subsequent international flight (n = ). at the u.s. airport where the survey took place, these travelers were required to go through cbp, collect their baggage, recheck their baggage, and go through a security checkpoint before reaching the departure gate. of these travelers, the vast majority indicated they expected to go through customs (86%) and a security checkpoint (80%), but fewer than half expected that they would need to collect their baggage at this airport and then recheck it (41%). the sample size was insufficient to determine if the expectancy violation had an effect on overall airport satisfaction.discussion of resultsinternational air travelers are likely to embark on long journeys that may span multiple time zones. as a result these travelers are likely to be fatigued and experience jet lag, which reduce their ability to concentrate and carry out the physical and mental tasks essential to wayfinding. they may also be experiencing travel anxiety and stress based on being in an unfamiliar environment. some of these travelers may have a limited capacity to speak or read in english. even if they travel frequently they are likely to be unfamiliar with the layout and processes of u.s. international airports. airports are large, complex environments that can be visually and mentally overwhelming to unfamiliar travelers.table effect of trip segment on satisfaction with main airport featuresresponse

transportation research record the results of the traveler survey determined that travelers in the process of making a connection between two international flights were significantly less likely to have a positive experience as com-pared with travelers departing, arriving, or making a connection between a domestic and international flight. less than half of those passengers making a connection between two international flights had a positive experience with security, customs, walking distances, wait times, wayfinding, or finding helpful staff.overall, the most important airport features were easy wayfinding and helpful staff, and the least important were short walking distances and access to shopping and restaurants. arriving travelers, however, were more likely to indicate that short walking distances were very important as compared with the other travelers.in comparing the airport features travelers rated as very important and their satisfaction with those features on the day of the survey, features that were rated very important and had a higher rate of satis - faction included easy wayfinding, helpful staff, airport cleanliness, and flight information displays. airport features that were rated very important and had a lower rate of satisfaction included access to free wi-fi and short lines at security and customs.more than half of all travelers making a connection between two international flights in the united states did not expect that they would have to collect and then recheck their baggage.conclusionstravelers who were most likely to be fatigued from a long journey and faced tasks—such as taking an international flight, going through customs, collecting and rechecking their baggage, going through security, and preparing to depart on a subsequent inter - national flight—were significantly less likely to have a positive experience at that airport. less than half of all travelers making a connection between two international flights expected they would need to collect and recheck their bags at a u.s. airport. unfamil-iarity with their environment, uncertainty regarding the next steps in the process, and deviations from their previous travel experi-ences contributed to elevated traveler anxiety. the combination of these factors could have adversely affected their satisfaction with an airport.table satisfaction with airport

(from gate to passport control) and departing travelers (from security checkpoint to departure gate).2. evaluate the effect of providing walking time and distance information on traveler experience to establish benchmarks for arriv-ing travelers (from gate to passport control) and departing travelers (from security checkpoint to departure gate).3. evaluate the effect of wait time information on traveler satis-faction at baggage claim, security checkpoint, and passport control to establish time benchmarks.acknowledgmentsthe author acknowledges the contributions of the acrp project -35 team,

passengers’ expectations of airport servicequality dale fodness and brian murray university of dallas, irving, texas, usa abstractpurpose– the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the development of a conceptual model of service quality in airports by conducting an empiricalinvestigation into passengers’ expectations for this service industry.design/methodology/approach– the paper is a qualitative exploration of the airport experience from the passengers’ perspective was combinedwith a review of relevant literature to identify variables, to clarify basic concepts and to generate a conceptual model of airport service qualityexpectations. the paper’s quantitative research was used to develop a self-report scale to measure passenger expectations of airport service quali ty, to test dimensionality and to evaluate scale reliability and validity.findings– qualitative and quantitative research on nearly ,000 airport users provided results suggesting that passengers’ expectations of airportservice quality is a multidimensional, hierarchical construct that includes three key dimensions: function, interaction and diversion.research limitations/implications– by bringing together different literatures and research paradigms to conceptualize service quality in a novelenvironment, the study contributes to the ongoing extension of service quality research. it is limited insofar as efforts to deﬁne a global expectati ons construct may have “homogenized” results.practical implications– this paper builds on the extant literature on service quality to propose an approach for measuring passengers’ expectationsof airport service quality that can serve as a foundation of a concise and easy-to-administer self-report measure for identifying and managing airpo rt service quality strategies.originality/value– the paper shows that by going beyond traditional service performance measures used in the airport industry and by introducingnew variables to the service quality literature, such as csikszentmihalyi’s taxonomy of activity, this study broadens and enriches both practice an d theory.keywordsairports, passengers, customer services quality, customer satisfactionpaper typeresearch paperan executive summary for managers can be found atthe end of this article. introduction the airport industry is changing rapidly. today’s air travelershave meaningful choices among airports and there is anincreasing urgency among airport marketers to differentiatethemselves by meeting the needs of customers better than thecompetition. while passengers’ perception of airport servicequality is only one of several variables (e.g. routes, scheduling,location and prices) that contribute to overall airportattractiveness, it is nevertheless an important variablebecause of the increasing importance of a customerorientation to competitive advantage in this industry.aviation trade publications and airport press releasesprovide evidence that managers in the airport industryclearly understand the importance of their customers’perceptions of service quality (aeroporti di roma s.p.a.,2004; bomenblit, ; gooding, ). academic andindustry researchers regularly measure passenger perceptionsof airport services quality to benchmark performance metricsdirectly from the “voice” of the customer (chen, ), toidentify opportunities for service improvement (yeh and kuo,2002) and to avoid losing valuable passenger trafﬁc (rhoadeset al., ). in addition, airport marketers research passengerneeds and wants for the purposes of enhancing non-aviationrelated revenues from restaurant and retail offerings(danyliew and cohen, ; harrison, ).the nature of the expectations underlying airport servicequality perceptions is unclear. unlike the more widelyaccepted gap-theory model for measuring service quality(i.e. subtracting a customer’s perceived level of servicereceived from what was expected), both academic andcommercial airport researchers are more likely to measureservice quality by establishing and monitoring serviceperformance measures which may or may not be informedby direct customer input (yeh and kuo, ). often, thesemeasures are internal (e.g. number of complaints, wait/servicetime for baggage delivery or check-in). internal measures ofservice performance are useful for benchmarking processes,but at the same time suspect because these measures aretypically derived from managers rather than from passengers,thus lacking a true customer perspective. even when service the current issue and full text archive of this journal is available

accepted: december 492 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) performance measures are external – intended to measure theattitudes and opinions of customers directly – the lack of asystematic understanding of airport customers’ expectationsmakes it likely that what is measured will be those attributesthat are the most obvious and easy to operationalize. the netresult can be a misguided effort to improve service quality inways that are unimportant to customers, thus failing to offerthe value that drives customer choice among alternatives.not only has the airport research tradition largely ignoredthe gap-theory method of service quality measurement, themarketing and services literatures (the major proponents ofgap-theory method service quality research) have focusedlittle attention on airports or on passengers, a remarkablydiverse group who consume in transit as they spend extendedperiods of time in elaborate servicescapes where they ﬁndthemselves as the result of a highly limited process of decisionmaking. as a result, while it is possible to describe passengerpreferences on issues ranging from airport signage to restroomcleanliness, there is no generally accepted theory-based modelof airport service quality nor is there a comprehensive proﬁleof the experiences, expectations and perceptual inﬂuences ofpassengers in this setting.we believe that the airport industry could beneﬁt from thecollective insights and the best practices of other serviceindustries that have faced similar issues, and that themainstream service quality literature could learn from theextension of established and emergent theory to the airport’sunique service environment. therefore, the purpose of ourstudy is to contribute to the development of a conceptualmodel of perceived service quality in airports by conductingan empirical investigation of the nature and role ofexpectations in this understudied service category. weproceed as follows. first, although airports are familiar tomany, the airport business is not and so we begin with a briefindustry overview. second, we review the limited literaturespeciﬁc to airport quality management and passengersatisfaction. third, we use a review of relevant literaturesinformed by qualitative research to categorize expectations offrequent airport users. next, we describe the methods used totest our preliminary model, along with the results. finally, wediscuss interpretations of our ﬁndings, explore managerialimplications and suggest directions for future research. airport industry overview airports have been a consistent growth segment in the traveland transportation industry (danyliew and cohen, ).over the last several decades, the global aviation industry hassustained annual growth rates of ﬁve to six percent (graham,2003). more than .2 billion passengers passed through theworld’s airports in (airports council international,2004). north american airports account for over percentof the world’s total air trafﬁc and in excess of .2 millionpassengers transit through us airports daily (graham, ).(compare this with a more familiar services industry,hospitality, where approximately .6 million hotel rooms aresold daily in the us (travel industry association of american(tia), ).) of the world’s busiest airports, are inthe us (airports council international, ). estimates arethat us airports generate in excess of $380 billion a year ineconomic activity (rhoadeset al., ).demand for air transport slowed in recent years because ofthe global economic downturn. following the events ofseptember , , airports experienced dramatic declinesin passenger trafﬁc with us airports suffering the greatestlosses (graham, ). when growth returns, us airporttrafﬁc is forecast to increase by nearly percent by , toover billion passengers per year (rhoades et al., ). anticipating the need for expanded airport capacity in theus, approximately $60 billion is currently being spent oncapital development projects such as runways, terminals,access roads, safety and security and noise mitigation (federalaviation administration, ).airport customers are remarkably varied and includepassengers, airlines, employees, concessionaires, tenants andothers. this study focuses on passengers (air travelers) – theend users of airport facilities and services. passenger behaviorand expectations of the airport experience depend on the typeof traveler, purpose of trip and his or her circumstances.despite their differences, however, all these customers are atthe airport for the sole purpose of transferring from ground-based to air modes of transportation. the airport is not adestination for air travelers. it is a transition point.at the airport, passengers encounter a bundle of tangibleand intangible services in a physical setting that bitner (1992)might characterize as an “elaborate servicescape”, similar to ahospital, with many corridors, queues, signs and complexinteractions. it is common for passengers to spend anextended period of time in the airport servicescape, averagingover one hour once they have entered the terminal (worldairport week, ).passengers arrive at an airport as the result of a limitedprocess of decision-making. research and common senseindicate that the primary drivers behind an individual’s choiceof airport are the air services the airport offers (a combinationof routes, scheduling and prices) and location (graham,2003). in most cases – although this is changing –passengers’ choice of airport is effectively constrained by theairlines’ decision of where to provide services.marketing did not play a signiﬁcant role in the managementof airports until the s, prior to which time the airport wascommonly viewed as a free public service or utility providedby governmental or quasi-governmental entities. deregulationof the airlines and other sectors of the air transport industry,however, motivated airports to begin competing for airlinerouting. marketing was ﬁrst introduced at airports that soughtto either enlarge or protect their airline customer base. as airtravelers became more sophisticated and demanding, airportscame to believe that they could inﬂuence airline routingdecisions by a “pull” strategy of directing marketing efforts toend users, offering enhanced services or the promise ofexceptional levels of customer satisfaction. as a result, by the1990s, many airports were concentrating greater attentionand investments on a wide array of marketing activities in aneffort to survive in an increasingly competitive marketplace.like many service industries, the airport industry turned toservice quality as a strategy for achieving competitiveadvantage (lee-mortimer, ).airport quality management and passenger satisfactionairport service quality literature and research is distinguishedfrom the mainstream service quality perspective (e.g. the gaptheory model) by its focus on quality at the attribute level.researchers attempting to measure airport service qualitytypically proceed from a list of objective indicators of servicethat are developed from discussions with airport stakeholderspassengers’ expectations of airport service qualitydale fodness and brian murray journal of services marketingv olume · number · · –506 493 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) rather than passengers, including airport and airlineoperators, consultants, regulators and travel industrymanagers. only a limited amount of conceptual andempirical work on passengers’ perceptions of airport servicequality exists. rhoadeset al.(2000) reviewed existingliterature to develop a list of “key airport quality factors”from the perspective of “various stakeholders”. survey datawas collected from airport operators and consultants whowere asked to weight the relative importance of the identiﬁedfactors to airport service quality. respondents were also askedto “rate the same factors from a passenger perspective in orderto gauge the extent to which their perceptions were“passenger-focused” (p. ). passengers themselves werenot included in this study. factor analysis of the data from the150 responses received (27 percent response rate) identiﬁedfour factors: passenger service issues, airport access, airline-airport interface and inter-terminal transport.chen (2002) and yeh and kuo (2002), writing in thetransportation literature, both approached airport servicequality as a setting within which to test conceptualframeworks. yeh and kuo (2002) consulted taiwaneseairport managers, government ofﬁcials, academics and travelagents to identify six airport service categories: comfort,processing time, convenience, courtesy of staff, informationvisibility and security. they used these categories as the basisfor collecting data from taiwanese tour guides andoperators. the data was analyzed using fuzzy multi-attributedecision making analysis (madm) to demonstrate “aneffective alternative to performance evaluation of airportservices involving subjective assessments of qualitativeattributes” (p. ). passengers were not included in this study.chen (2002) used quality-benchmarking deployment as anapproach to organize airport quality elements and passengerquality requirements. initial items were identiﬁed from face-to-face interviews with various stakeholders (including butnot limited to passengers) at chaing kai shek internationalairport (cks). items were rendered into survey questions toevaluate the performance of six major asia-paciﬁc airports.the quantitative data collection sample included airlinecompanies, forwarders, scholars and passengers. the ﬁndingsindicated that “convenience of transport facilities connectingto the outside”, “interior design and layout” and “informationservice of the airport” were critical service quality attributes.moving from academic research to industry practice, lists ofairport service attributes are developed by individual airports,industry associations and consultants for measuring airport“customer satisfaction” (aeroporti di roma s.p.a., ;airports council international, ; bomenblit, ;j.d. power, ). a typical example is the syndicatedaetra customer satisfaction survey, a joint undertaking ofairports council international (aci) and the internationalair transport association (iata). according to the aetraweb site, the information provided helps their users (airportmanagers) “understand how they perform and how toimprove” as they “continue to adopt market orientedbusiness strategies” (aetra, ). the ongoing aetrastudy is based on a self-completion questionnaire distributedto passengers at departure gates and covers a number ofaspects of passengers’ “on-the-day” airport experienceincluding: navigation, airport services and facilities, securityand immigration, airport environment and airline services.lists of attributes such as these can and do provide airportmanagers with useful information, but do not representservice quality as the concept has come to be understood inmarketing and services research and literature. although thecited studies and others like them do a good job of identifyingobjective service attributes, they do not address passengers’expectations or the underlying dimensionality of the servicequality construct from a theory-based perspective, which is atthe heart of the mainstream service quality literature.to summarize the current state-of-affairs of service qualitytheory and practice in the airport industry, compellingreasons for managing airport service quality exist and airportservice attributes are commonly measured. however, a widelyaccepted, integrated theory/model of the dimensionality ofpassenger expectations driving airport service qualityperceptions is lacking. leaving aside the more academicquestions this theory gap raises, from a practical airportmarketing perspective airport managers need a valid andreliable scale (that is also concise and easily administered) formeasuring airport service quality in order to: .assess customer expectations about and perceptions ofairport service quality at individual airports as well as atthose of its competitors; .identify and prioritize service areas requiring managerialattention and action to ensure and improve service qualityand customer satisfaction; and .provide the airport’s managers with indications of how toestablish and sustain competitive advantage based on aservice quality strategy.in the remainder of this paper, research designed to developand test a scale to investigate passengers’ expectations ofairport service quality is described. both qualitative andquantitative studies using airport passengers as samples wereperformed to develop the expectations survey item pool, toinvestigate dimensionality of service quality expectations inthe airport environment and to assess the resulting model’svalidity and reliability. we begin by combining a qualitativeexploration of the airport experience from the passengers’perspective with a review of relevant literature to identifyvariables, to clarify basic concepts and to generate hypothesesin the form of a preliminary conceptual model of airportservice quality expectations. quantitative research was used todevelop a self-report scale to measure passenger expectationsof airport service quality, to test for dimensionality and toevaluate reliability and validity as prescribed by churchill’s(1979) paradigm for the development of self-report scales. airport service quality expectations: modeldevelopment generating airport service quality themes frompassengersconsistent with accepted practice in marketing and servicequality research (brady and cronin, ; dabholkar et al., ; zeithamlet al., ), we ﬁrst conducted qualitativeresearch on the passenger airport experience to gain anunderstanding of the dimensions of passengers’ expectationsof airport service quality. these studies were designed todevelop rather than to test hypotheses because the airportquality management and passenger satisfaction literatures lackestablished theory suggesting formal relationships among thevariables of interest. in addition, neither servqual nor anyof its related operationalizations of the gap-theory model formeasuring service quality have been suggested for or adaptedpassengers’ expectations of airport service qualitydale fodness and brian murray journal of services marketingv olume · number · · –506 494 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) to airports (see, however, heunget al.,2 f o ra n application of servqual to airport restaurants). thus,the qualitative studies sought insights by collecting andanalyzing observations about personal airport experiences andexpectations from passengers. the approach of thisqualitative research was to investigate quality factors the airtraveler expects from an airport service encounter, to exploreair traveler experiences and problems and to identify theimportance of speciﬁc airport service expectations that mightcontribute to perceived service quality or to preferences forone airport over another. the research probed service qualityoutcomes, satisfaction and other intangibles of airportexpectations, along with facilities and more tangible aspectsof airports’ physical settings. in addition to providing the datafor development of preliminary conceptual bases forpassengers’ expectations of airport service quality, this phaseof the research generated an item pool for the construction ofa related expectations measurement instrument.three different qualitative methodologies – in-depthinterviews, focus groups and content analysis of verbatimcomments – were used to focus on passenger expectations ofairport service quality. the sampling frame, number ofresponses received and key respondent characteristics areindicated in table i.participants in the in-depth interviews and focus groupswere asked about their expectations of and experiences atairports in general, as well as their attitudes toward and theiropinions of speciﬁc airports with which they were familiar.those who responded with comments at an airport web sitealso were asked to respond to the open-ended question,“what is your favorite airport and why?”. content analysiswas applied to the data generated from all three qualitativemethodologies and, in accordance with herek (1987), anairport service quality theme was deﬁned by “any idea orcomplete thought somehow related to the respondent’s”reason for satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the airportexperience. results from the three qualitative studies werecompiled to create a master list of airport service qualitythemes. multiple mentions of the same theme wereeliminated. the ﬁnal list of airport service qualitythemes appears in the following list:1 an airport’s physical layout should

space. italicized items wereretained in the ﬁnal model.) the airport service quality construct we constructed out preliminary conceptual model of theexpectations of the airport experience using data obtainedfrom the passengers in our qualitative research and from theproscriptions provided by relevant literatures. the marketingand services literatures were chosen as appropriate. we alsoselected motivational psychology for its insights into howindividuals allocate their waiting time, which passengers atairports often have in excess. this combination yielded bothpreliminary dimensions of airport service quality expectationsand an item pool for developing a survey instrument. thisapproach is well documented in qualitative research in servicequality (see dabholkaret al., ). it also resulted in theexclusion of some items from the original master list of airportservice quality themes. for example, if passengers identiﬁeddirectional signage at the airport as a key expectation and theliterature provided either conceptual or empirical support forthis theme, it was included. if they mentioned expectations ofhigher prices at airports, it was excluded if not supported orsuggested by our focal literatures. the literature itselfsuggested certain relevant concepts, such as whetherinteractions with fellow passengers inﬂuenced expectationsof airport service quality. if, as in this case, such themes werenot present in the qualitative ﬁndings, they were not included. a preliminary conceptual model of airport servicequality expectations our resulting model of airport service quality expectations iscomposed of three primary dimensions – servicescape,interaction and services (see figure ). further, the modelsuggests that each dimensions has three subdimensions.similar hierarchical structures for perceived service quality inother settings have been reported (brady and cronin, ;dabholkaret al., ). brady and cronin (2001) offer aplausible explanation: ...customers form their service quality perceptions on the basis of anevaluation of performance at multiple levels and ultimately combine theseevaluations to arrive at an overall service quality perception (p. ). dimension : servicesfor services that require customers to be present in theservice “factory” for extended periods of time, bitner (1992)theorized that the facility itself – the “servicescape” – has asigniﬁcant inﬂuence on overall service encounter qualityperceptions. the servicescape includes all the objectivefactors controllable by the service provider that facilitatecustomer actions during the service encounter and enhancetheir overall service quality perception. research hasdocumented the inﬂuence of the physical environment onservice quality perceptions in restaurants (rys et al., ), retail stores (dabholkaret al., ), and a variety of otherservice businesses (brady and cronin, ). becauseairports require passengers’ physical presence and often asigniﬁcant time commitment, the physical environment of theairport can inﬂuence perceptions of the overall quality of theservice encounter. for example: ...assume that a traveler enters an airport and (1) is confused because he orshe cannot ﬁnd signage giving directions to the assigned gate and (2) ispassengers’ expectations of airport service qualitydale fodness and brian murray journal of services marketingv olume · number · · –506 496 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) emotionally distressed because of crowds, poor acoustics and hightemperatures. here the servicesca pe directly impacts the traveler’s evaluation of the quality of his or her airport experience (bitner, , p. ). as approximately half of the airport service quality themes(see previous list) were identiﬁed as representing bitner’sservicescape dimensions, the ﬁrst primary airport servicequality expectations dimension we propose is servicescape.h1. passengers’ expectations of the servicescape directlyinﬂuence their airport service quality perceptions.the basic servicescape construct includes three key elements:spatial layout and functionality, ambient conditions and signs/symbols. spatial layout and functionality refers not only to thearrangement and relationships of machinery, equipment andfurnishings, but also to the ability of these to facilitateperformance and the accomplishment of service customergoals. this dimension is considered to be of particularimportance because the physical settings of service encountersare purposeful environments that exist to fulﬁll speciﬁc needsof service customers. ambient conditions are factors (e.g.temperature, lighting, noise, music and scent) that affectperceptions of the environment. empirical studies conﬁrmthat these factors inﬂuence service quality perceptions ofrestaurants (milliman, ) and retail venues (milliman,1986; yalch and spangenberg, ). signs and symbolscommunicate explicit (i.e. posted labels, directions and rules)or implicit (quality of materials and furnishings) meaningabout the physical environment.our qualitative research yielded clear evidence for all threecomponents of servicescape. the ﬁrst servicescapesubdimension combines elements of both spatial layout andfunctionality, readily recognizable from bitner’s (1992)description of the servicescape. it makes intuitive sense thatthese two concepts should be very closely related as togetherthey capture how well the airport layout “facilitate(s)performance and the accomplishment of goals” (bitner,1992) the importance of facility layout to perceived servicequality has been empirically established (baker et al., ; brady and cronin, ; dabholkaret al.1996). participantsin the in-depth interviews and focus groups consistentlystressed the critical importance of being able to ﬁnd their waythrough the airport to either their departure gate, facilities(i.e. restrooms) or amenities (i.e. shops and snack bars). atthe web site, comments relevant to this dimension included,“i like the setting – it’s easy to ﬁnd everything”, “easy accessto everything”, and “airport is designed so gates are closetogether”. as suggested by the literature review, andreinforced by the qualitative studies, spatial layout andfunctionality was proposed as the ﬁrst servicescapesubdimension of our model.h2. passengers’ expectations of spatial layout andfunctionality inﬂuence their airport service qualityperceptions.our second proposed servicescape subdimension is ambientconditions, similar to bitner’s (1992) original dimension.while relatively few themes were generated around this aspectof the airport experience, passenger respondents in all threequalitative studies speciﬁcally mentioned them. themesincluded: “an airport should be clean”, “an airport shouldhave soothing music playing throughout its facilities andterminals”, and “an airport should offer as much natural lightthrough windows, skylights, etc. as possible.” in other servicesettings, ambient conditions have been found to have eitherstressful or relaxing effects on customers (milliman, ,1986; yalch and spartenberg, ), and we propose thatthey also play a role in expectations underlying service qualityperceptions of airports.h3. passengers’ expectations of ambient conditionsinﬂuence their airport service quality perceptions.the third subdimension we propose, signs and symbols, onceagain closely resembles the original bitner (1992) dimensionand addresses both explicit signals (signage) and implicitsignals (de´cor). the role of signage in perceived servicequality has been established in research (callan and kyndt,2001). passengers in the three qualitative studies stressed theimportance of both informational signage (ﬂight informationdisplays or “fids”) and directional signage “an airport’sexternal signs should clearly direct me to airport services suchas parking, car rentals, terminals, etc.” as a symbol, airportde´cor was the sole implicit signal speciﬁcally mentioned bypassengers in all three qualitative studies and it is a recurringtheme in retail service quality research, as well (dabholkaret al., ). comments included: “an airport should displayart”, “an airport’s de´cor should reﬂect the local culture of thecity at which it is located”, and “an airport should havecurrent de´cor”. these themes, along with ﬁndings fromrelated research, support our inclusion of signs and symbolsas a servicescape subdimension in the model.h4. passengers’ expectations of signs and symbolsinﬂuence their airport service quality perceptions.figure

downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) dimension : service providersa second inﬂuence on service quality perceptions wherecustomers’ physical presence is required for service delivery isinteractions with service personnel (bitner, , ; bradyand cronin, ; brown and swartz, ; dabholkar et al., ; elliott, ; groonroos, ; saleh and ryan, ;surprenant and solomon, ). the most widely known anddiscussed means used to measure consumer perceptions ofservice interaction quality is servqual, a multi-attributescale commonly comprised of ﬁve dimensions: tangibles,reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy (croninand taylor, ; oh and parks, ). although the intendedscope of servqual extends beyond service customer –provider interactions, three of the dimensions explicitly focus onthe relational aspects of service quality (responsiveness,assurance, empathy) and the remaining two (tangibles andreliability) touch upon customer contact personnel issues aswell. servqual has been applied and tested in a number ofempirical studies involving services with elaborateservicescapes, including hotels (saleh and ryan, ; gettyand getty, ), restaurants (bojanic and rosen, ;heunget al., ), health clinics (babackus and mangold,1989), hospitals (carman, ), banks (spreng and singh,1993) and airlines (elliott, ). despite the lack of a previousapplication of servqual to airports, perceptions of servicequality for other services with elaborate servicescapes and forairport environments are likely to share some commondimensions in the area of service interactions and similarinﬂuences on service quality perceptions. therefore, the seconddimension proposed for our model of airport service qualityexpectations is service providers.h5. passengers’ expectations of the interactions withservice providers directly inﬂuence their airportquality perceptions.our service providers dimension partially resembles theoriginal parasuramanet al.(1988) servqual construct.nearly a quarter of the themes generated by passengers in thequalitative study were clearly identiﬁable as servqualdimensions. included were cites to tangibles (“the way anairport employee is dressed should easily identify theirfunction”), responsiveness (“employees at an airport shouldnever be too busy to respond to my requests promptly”),assurance (“i expect employees at an airport to becourteous”) and empathy (“there should be employees atan airport available to offer me individualized attention”).while our service providers dimension does containelements of the original parasuraman et al.(1988) servqual construct, there is an alternative that better ﬁtsthe observed data. brady and cronin (2001), as well as others(bitner, ; bitneret al., ; czepielet al., ; groonroos, ), have provided conceptual and empiricalsupport for three distinct factors that underlie consumerperceptions of their interactions with service providers:attitudes, behavior and expertise of the service provider.without exception, the service provider interaction themesgenerated by the qualitative sequence of studies referred toone of these three factors.h6. passengers’ perceptions of the attitudes of serviceproviders inﬂuence their airport quality perceptions.h7. passengers’ perceptions of airport service quality areinﬂuenced by their expectations of employee behavior.h8. expectations of employees’ expertise inﬂuencepassengers’ perceptions of airport service quality.dimension : servicesthe necessity for passengers to be physically present in theairport emphasizes issues of time and of how time is spent.servicescape theory addresses this in terms of spatial layoutand functionality. servqual focuses on time spent waiting.neither servicescape nor servqual, however, addresslarger issues of how the customer’s time is allocated orinvested. because the airport experience demands asigniﬁcant time commitment – and for many passengerstime is the ultimate scarce resource – the extent to which theairport facilitates or frustrates their use of time can have asigniﬁcant inﬂuence on perceptions of the overall quality ofthe service encounter. research shows that once a passengerhas entered the terminal his or her average wait can exceedone hour (darko, ). factors such as ﬂight delays andcancellations due to security, breakdowns and weather, canprolong time spent at the airport. research also hashighlighted the importance of time spent waiting at airports(darko, ), especially to business travelers. given thevalue of time spent waiting to many passengers, morefavorable perceptions of airport service quality may beassociated with airport options that provide them withgreater control over how they experience their waiting time.this raises the question, “what would passengers choose todo with the time they spend waiting in airports?”.a body of work (e.g. csickszentmihalyi and graef, ;larson and richards, ) documents that what people dowith their time can be divided into three major activities:productive, maintenance and leisure. depending on theirstage in the life cycle and employment status, many peoplespend much of their time engaged in productive activitiessuch as job-related work or education-related study. anothersigniﬁcant chunk of time is taken up by maintenance activitiesdirected at both people’s bodies (e.g. eating, resting,grooming) and their possessions (e.g. housework, shopping).discretionary time left over from productive or maintenanceactivities, is available for leisure pursuits. three primaryforms are: media consumption such as watching television,listening to music or reading; conversation; and more activeleisure including hobbies, sports, exercise and going out torestaurants, movies and the mall. thus, research suggests thatpassengers at the airport have the potential for actively seekingto achieve goals and objectives related to work, related tokeeping their body and possessions functioning properly andrelated to whatever they do with their free time. it is withinthese three domains of activity that the airport experience canfacilitate or frustrate how passengers choose to use theirprecious time spent waiting. how well it does at either canhave a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on perceptions of the overallquality of the airport service encounter. thus, the thirddimension in our model of airport service quality expectationsis the services offered by the airport.h9. passengers’ perceptions of airport service quality aredirectly inﬂuenced by their expectations of how airportservices will facilitate their activities during the timethat they are physically present at the airport.passengers in all three qualitative studies consistentlygenerated themes that identiﬁed services needed or wantedduring the time that they were at the airport. comments suchpassengers’ expectations of airport service qualitydale fodness and brian murray journal of services marketingv olume · number · · –506 498 downloaded

activities.passengers in the qualitative research listed both. commentsincluded: “nationally known retail outlets should be availableat airports” and “a variety of food choices should be availableat airports”. themes related to leisure activities identiﬁed inall three qualitative studies included “an airport should offerservices such as massage booths, salons and recliner lounges”and “airports should house educational museums forpassengers to enjoy during layovers”. thus, our qualitativedata support csikszentmihalyi’s (1997) typology, becausepassengers consistently cited services that could be easilyidentiﬁed as important to activities in one of these activityareas.to summarize, we propose a hierarchical factor structurefor airport service quality with three basic dimensions, withoverall service quality as a second-order factor. further, eachof the three dimensions have three subdimensions each (seefigure ). airport service quality expectations: test of themodel research methodologythe purpose of this quantitative study was to design,implement and test an objective approach to measuringpassengers’ expectations of airport service quality.item generation and scale developmentall airport service quality themes generated by the in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and web sitecomments (described in the qualitative sequence of studies)were rewritten as questionnaire items (see previous list) toform an original scale that was used to collect data from asample of frequent ﬂyers. each airport service quality themewas paired with a seven-point scale ranging from “stronglyagree” (7) to “strongly disagree” (1).data collectiondata for the quantitative sequence of analyses were collectedfrom a purchased list of ,765 frequent ﬂyers (deﬁned as threeor more air trips per year) with an annual income over$50,000. the sampling frame was nationwide in scope andconsisted of an equal percentage of males and females.approximately percent, or , of the ,765 surveysmailed out were returned. the analytic techniques used inthis study are sensitive to missing data and for that reasoncasewise deletion was used to remove cases. even afterremoval of unusable cases, this response rate is high comparedto other mail surveys reported in recent marketing literature,but about average for travel, tourism and hospitality studies.no incentive was offered to respondents.the responses (n¼700) contained a nearly equal numberof females and males. the age of the respondents ranged from17 to with an average age of years. respondentsreported an average of nearly four pleasure trips and ninebusiness trips by air within the past year. approximately percent of the respondents named one of ten airports as theirhome airport. included in the top ten airports mentionedwere large hub airports (dfw, atl, den) as well as smallerairports (dal, hnl, las).analysisto test the hypotheses, data were analyzed using bothexploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis (cfa).exploratory factor analysis was used to explain the patternof correlations within the set of observed variables and tocompare those empirical results against each of the threedimensions in our expectations model (figure ). cfa wasthen used to conﬁrm the second-order dimensionalitysuggested by the qualitative research and literature review,as modiﬁed by the results of the exploratory factor analysis.results exploratory factor analysesthe scales used to test our dimension/subdimensionhypotheses were: servicescape (h2-h4), service personnel(h6-h8) and services (h10-h12). in order to determinewhether the items as we assigned them actually do representthe dimensionality suggested from the combined literaturereview and qualitative research, the items comprising eachseparate scale were subjected to a maximum likelihoodexploratory factor analysis.for each of the three scales, exploratory factor analysisinitially resulted in a number of factors, retention of whichwas at ﬁrst based on whether the individual factor had aneigenvalue greater than or equal to one. the reduced factorsolution for each scale was then subjected to a varimaxrotation seeking more easily interpretable results. while thevarimax rotation produced interpretable loadings, each scalealso contained items that loaded highly on more than onefactor. as per churchill (1979), only items that loaded on asingle factor were selected for the ﬁnal version of the scale.also, in all three scale solutions some items failed to load onany factor at the .6 level or higher and were removed. itemswere reduced and sub-dimensions were modiﬁed for eachscale in an iterative process.next, coefﬁcient alphas and item-to-total correlations werecalculated for each scale. where values of coefﬁcient alphaindicated that further deletion of items would improve thealpha value, this was done. recomputation of alphas anditem-to-total correlations and reexamination of the factorstructures were repeated. final results are presented intables ii-iv. results both supported our preliminaryconceptual model for passengers’ expectations of airportservice quality and also suggested modiﬁcations. thefollowing section details how and why our original modelwas re-speciﬁed to accommodate both theory and data.servicescapetable ii presents the results of an exploratory (maximumlikelihood) factor analysis on the servicescape scale. a two-factor solution was identiﬁed. the ﬁrst factor contains itemsfrom the original sub-dimensions of spatial layout andfunctionality and signs and symbols. as the

is retained in there-speciﬁcation of our original model, but has been renamed“function” to more accurately reﬂect the items retained andfactors generated. in addition, the effectiveness and efﬁciencyfactors replace the original spatial layout and functionality,ambient conditions and signs and symbols sub-dimensions.service personnelour original service personnel dimension speciﬁed threesubdimensions: attitudes, behavior and expertise. the resultsof the exploratory factor analysis on the original servicepersonnel scale, including items that failed to loadmeaningfully on either of the other two original scales,suggest an interesting modiﬁcation that both contracts andexpands our initial conceptualization (see table iii). theitems that loaded on all three factors are mainly related to thebehavior subdimension from our initial model. the ﬁrst factoris made up of items that, collectively, can be interpreted asservice personal behaviors that facilitate access of passengersto them. the second factor is clearly about the servicepersonnel’s problem-solving behavior. the third factor isperhaps the most intriguing. it is mostly composed of itemsoriginally placed in the signs and symbols subdimension ofthe original model, where they failed to load meaningfully.when added to the service personnel scale, however, theycombined with employee behavior related to advice onservices available in the local area. in the re-speciﬁcation ofour initial model, the term “service personnel” is replacedwith “interaction” to more accurately reﬂect the factorsgenerated by our analysis: access, problem-solving and advice.servicesresults from the exploratory factor analysis of the servicesscale are presented in table iv . as shown, a four-factorsolution was generated. this factor pattern was producedwhen the items from the original ambiance subdimension –which failed to load as initially speciﬁed under the primaryservicescape dimension – were added to the services scale.the ﬁrst factor (maintenance) and the fourth factor(productivity), reﬂecting csikszentmihalyi’s domains ofactivity, remain relatively unchanged from the initial model.the items loaded on the second factor are all from theoriginal ambiance subdimension and relate to the “feeling” ofa particular airport setting. the third factor contains itemsalso from the original ambiance scale, but of a more tangiblenature, describing the de´cor of an airport.taken together, these four factors suggest an underlyingconstruct more complex than the original services dimension.the combination of ambiance-related factors along with theactivity-related factors may be describing an environmentperceived by the passenger as offering opportunities foraesthetic, cognitive and sensory satisfaction. such anenvironment is no doubt of special importance toconsumers who, as a necessary condition of theirconsumption of a service product (the airport), are requiredto spend relatively large amounts of time there. thisinterpretation of the results led to a revision of the primarydimension label from “services” to “diversion,” reﬂecting aturning aside from focusing on the fact that the passenger is,in effect, “trapped” in the airport servicescape towardactivities that redirect their attention or stimulate themaesthetically.based on the results of the exploratory factor analysis, ourpreliminary airport service quality expectations model wasrevised and speciﬁed as a second-order factor model (seefigure ).conﬁrmatory factor analysisthe revised structure pattern of the remaining items wasevaluated through a conﬁrmatory analysis using amos .01(analysis of moment structures). we applied the traditionalstructural equations approach, total disaggregation, usingeach item as a separate indicator of the relevant construct thusproviding the most rigorous and detailed level of analysis.submission of the model speciﬁed by figure failed toachieve a feasible solution. modiﬁcations were made byremoving latent variables in an iterative fashion and re-testingthe resulting model. as a result, access, advice and ambiancesubdimensions were eliminated from the ﬁnal model. accessand ambiance, upon closer inspection, were both concernedwith generic service issues that were not speciﬁc to theairport. the items contained in advice were more focused ondestinations than on airports.the revised structure pattern of the remaining items wasthen evaluated and an acceptable ﬁt was found( x2=df¼3:631, gfi¼0:912, agfi¼0:889, cfi¼0:894, rmsea¼0:068) for the model shown in figure . theunidimensionality and convergent validity of the scale isachieved if the agfi is above .90, while the root meansquare of approximation (rmsea) is less than .08. thefactor loadings and gamma values for the third-order factormodel are detailed on figure . one lambda value for eachdimension and subdimension was set at .0. an examinationof the modiﬁcation indices did not suggest any changes in themodel. the results led us to conclude that the proposed factorstructure for airport service quality is supported.construct reliability and validity of the airport servicequality expectations scalethe alpha for the global construct was estimated at .85 andfor the second-order constructs at .79 (function), .74(interaction) and .80 (diversion). cronbach’s alpha wascomputed for subdimensions and the values ranged from .81to .61. convergent validity of the airport service quality scalecannot be determined at this time by the normal practice ofusing different methods to test the construct since we onlyused one method. all of the items loaded highly on the factorsto which they were assigned, however, which can beconsidered a test of convergent validity of the scale. a testof discriminant validity is especially important, given thatsome of the dimensions are highly correlated. one acceptedtest of discriminant validity is to determine whether thecovariance and two standard errors add to less than .00. weused this procedure on all possible pairs of the dimensionsand found values ranging from .75 to .98. thus, alldimensions are statistically distinct even after correcting formeasurement error and do have discriminant validity. in apractical sense, they are highly correlated and this couldexplain why there is so much common variance to make ahigher order

“voice of the world’s airports”, representing ,550airports in over countries in all regions of the world, hasdesignated quality of service at airports a “vital factor in itsown right” (airports council international, ). this studyhas several implications for research and practice in this area.by following best practices from marketing and servicesresearch to identify and test the dimensionality of passengers’expectations for airport service quality, we provide freshfigure re-speciﬁed model following exploratory factor analysis figure final model – hierarchical structure for

conceptualize service quality in a novelenvironment with a unique group of consumers whoseservice experience takes place over an extended period of timewithin an elaborate servicescape, this study contributes to theongoing extension of service quality research. furthermore,by going beyond traditional service performance measuresused in the airport industry and by introducing new variablesto the service quality literature, such as csikszentmihalyi’s(1997) taxonomy of activity, this study broadens and enrichesboth practice and theory in this domain. for example,although the issue of waiting time has generated much interestamong both marketing and service researchers (cf. katz et al., ; jones and peppiatt, ), focus on how customers useor would prefer to use time spent waiting in prolonged serviceencounters is lacking. this study contributes to anunderstanding of the role of time spent waiting in serviceencounters in several ways. first, we showed that the servicesavailable to passengers as they wait at the airport are critical totheir expectations of service quality. second, we extend theoryon the role of waiting time in service quality by examiningwhat activities (productive, maintenance, leisure) passengersperceive to be facilitated by the services available to them asthey wait. third, we ﬁnd empirically supported relationshipsnot only directly between expectations of airport servicequality as a higher order factor and a primary servicedimension, but also between the primary dimension and twosubdimensions composed of services that contribute topassengers’ maintenance and productive activities, as well.while focused on the airport industry, other service industrieswith similar characteristics (e.g. healthcare) should beneﬁtfrom the insights suggested by this research.with the emergence of highly competitive markets andcommoditization of the airport offering, differentiationthrough service quality is a strategic imperative for manyairport managers. this study advances strategic thinkingabout airport service quality in three ways. first, itdemonstrates empirically,using data collected frompassengers, the structure underlying their expectations ofairport service quality. second, it contributes to airportmarketing strategy by identifying the key roles of servicescape,service providers and services in the competitive landscape ofthe industry. speciﬁcally, the study shows clearly what is and– perhaps more importantly – what is not important topassengers making choices among competing airports. third,this study builds on the extant literature on service quality topropose a method for measuring passengers’ expectations ofairport service quality that can serve as a foundation of aconcise and easy-to-administer self-report measure foridentifying and managing service quality strategies to gainand hold advantage in an increasingly competitiveenvironment.this study’s contributions must be considered in light of itslimitations. first and foremost, a single study of passengerexpectations is not sufﬁcient to inform a fully-developedconceptualization of airport service quality. second, ourefforts to deﬁne a global expectations construct may haveinadvertently “homogenized”our results. speciﬁcally,passenger data was collected in a contextual void.respondents were asked to indicate their expectations forairports in general, without taking into considerationpassenger, trip or airport characteristics. in terms ofpassenger characteristics, for example, cultural differencesare known to affect perceived service quality (espinoza,1999). this study included only domestic (us) passengers.generalization of the model to a global market thus awaitsreplication across cultures. trip characteristics – mostimportantly purpose-of-trip – is one of the most inﬂuentialfactors inﬂuencing traveler perceptions and behavior(fodness, ). while this study included both businessand leisure travelers, further insights could be gained fromtrip-speciﬁc passenger expectations research. there is greatvariability in airports (graham, ). some cater almostexclusively to business travelers (london city airport) andothers service primarily leisure travelers (ft lauderdaleinternational airport). some are nearly always crowded (jfk)while others have excess capacity and unused spaces (kualalumpur international airport). a comprehensive model ofairport service quality expectations and perceptions will needto include airport characteristics in its conceptualunderpinnings.managerial implicationsthis study has clear implications for service qualitymeasurement and management at airports. the mostobvious is that in order for airport service quality strategiesand tactics to yield the desired results, service quality ofairports must be deﬁned by and measured from passengersthemselves and not by or from others. more speciﬁcally,researchers in this industry have sometimes relied on airportand travel professionals for specifying and even for measuringairport service quality “from a passengers’ perspective”. tablei shows many of the service attributes commonly measured byairports were left out of the focal model which was developedfrom passenger data. it is reasonable to interpret this outcomeas reﬂecting the fact that service elements omitted from themodel were unimportant, less important or invisible to thepassenger. instead of attributing more importance (or soleimportance) to managers’ beliefs about what passengersexpect from service quality at airports, this articlerecommends studying service quality perceptions in acustomer-focused manner in order to best determine whereand how airport service quality initiatives can make asigniﬁcant difference to the customer. thus, a keymanagerial implication of this study is a passenger-drivenframework for the airport manager on how to enhance thequality of the service quality management process therebyimproving service quality in the airport in ways that really domatter to the passenger.the study offers direction for managers who seek to useservice quality as a critical component of their airport’scompetitive strategy. customer-driven service qualityenhancements affect not only passengers’ perceptions, butalso the overall attractiveness of the airport relative to itscompetitors. thus, allocating an appropriate amount ofresources to the key factors of airport service quality canincrease the likelihood of being perceived by a passenger asthe best choice, relative to the alternatives available.our evidence of the dimensionality of passengers’expectations of airport service quality reiterates recent acicalls for focusing managerial attention on the centralimportance passengers. “passengers ...demand higher

strong support for developing an approach toairport service quality measurement that supports managerswho need to make informed decisions as to how best to fulﬁlltheir industry mandate and to achieve competitive advantagein the marketing.implications for future researchthis study holds implications for further research in theservices, service quality and airport quality and passengersatisfaction domains. signiﬁcant contributions could resultfrom additional study of the relationships among servicequality, servicescape and csikszentmihalyi’s typology of howindividuals use their time. several authors have already addedvaluable insights into the role of the servicescape in servicequality (brady and cronin, ; dabholkar et al., ). a more explicit and systematic investigation of how theservicescape facilitates or frustrates customers’ activity goals(productivity, maintenance and leisure) should be of interestto researchers of service quality in servicescapes wherecustomers spend extended periods of time and to servicesmarketers who focus on waiting time and queuing issues (e.g.bus terminals, train stations and cruise ships).given that prior academic research in airport service qualityis limited and primarily focused on service performancemeasure methodologies, that literature could beneﬁt fromfurther application of gap theory methodology for analyzingservice quality. two critical investigations needed are furtherstudy of the relationships between airport service quality andother important airport performance measures. the relativeimportance of service quality in the passengers’ airport choicedecision is currently the subject of speculation requiringempirical inquiry and speciﬁcation. in a related area, theinﬂuence of passenger preferences for airports on airlinechoice of airports requires further study. conclusion recent events underscore the immediacy of industry interestin the measurement and management of service quality atairports. there is a corresponding groundswell amongacademics in marketing and services of interest in howextant and evolving service quality theory “ﬁts” in previouslyunexplored service settings. this study was developed toprovide insights into the process of service qualitymeasurement at airports and to contribute to the knowledgebase in services quality theory and practice. to that end, thisarticle:

505 downloaded by universidad de los andes colombia at :09 january (pt) executive summary and implications formanagers and executives this summary has been provided to allow managers and executivesa rapid appreciation of the content of the article. those with aparticular interest in the topic covered may then read the articlein tototo take advantage of the more comprehensive description ofthe research undertaken and its results to get the full beneﬁt of thematerial present.one of the ﬁrst things you read when you click onto the website of new york’s kennedy airport is a link asking forcustomer feedback. liverpool’s john lennon airport, too, hasa prominent online customer service form (although it saysyou might have to wait a week if you want a reply). they’renot alone. but it hasn’t always been the case.even though for many passengers, their “choice” of airportis not a choice at all but dictated by where an airline operatesits services, times are changing, particularly in north americawhere airports account for over per cent of the world’stotal air trafﬁc and $60 billion is being spent on capitaldevelopment projects such as runways, terminals, accessroads, safety and security and noise mitigation, to expand usairport capacity.today, air travelers have more meaningful choices amongairports, and frequent ﬂyers are knowledgeable about what isoffered and what is lacking, and consequently there’s anincreasing urgency among airport marketers to differentiatethemselves from the opposition.the airports council international, the global traderepresentative of the world’s airports, has recently called formanagers to place more focus on the central importance ofpassengers, saying that passengers demand higher standardsof service and, where they have a choice, they will choose theairports which give the best quality of service.asking passengers about the service experience might seemglaringly obvious, but some service quality and performancemeasures have typically been derived from managersreporting issues “from a passenger perspective” such asnumbers of complaints about waiting for service, baggagedelivery or check-in.while such statistics have their uses, dale fodness andbrian murray comment: “the lack of a systematicunderstanding of airport customers’ expectations makes itlikely that what is measured will be those attributes that arethe most obvious and easy to operationalize. the net resultcan be a misguided effort to improve service quality in waysthat are unimportant to customers, thus failing to offer thevalue that drives customer choice among alternatives”.asking passengers what they expect is essential andenlightening, and maybe a cynic might say “is thereanything they don’t expect?” in the current survey, forinstance, expected concerns about waiting times, ﬂightinformation, restaurant facilities, ease of ﬁnding your wayabout, etc., were included among rather more demandingneeds such as “i would use a gym during a layover, “anairport should offer services such as massage booths, salons,and recliner lounges” and “airports should house educationalmuseums for passengers to enjoy during layovers”.other responses included requests that nationally-knownretail outlets and national chain restaurants should beavailable, there should be opportunities to enjoy the localcuisine, the airport should be clean, have plenty of space toprevent overcrowding, should display art and should havebusiness centers which provide personal computers, phonesand faxes.whatever the responses, if you’ve asked your customers,you should take notice of what they say – if you don’t maybethe competition will.a widely accepted, integrated theory/model of thedimensionality of passenger expectations driving airportservice quality perceptions is lacking. from a practicalairport marketing perspective airport managers need a validand reliable scale (that is also concise and easily administered)for measuring airport service quality in order to: .assess customer expectations about and perceptions ofairport service quality at individual airports as well as atthose of its competitors; .identify and prioritize service areas requiring managerialattention and action to ensure and improve service qualityand customer satisfaction; and .provide the airport’s managers with indications of how toestablish and sustain competitive advantage based on aservice quality strategy.instead of attributing more importance (or sole importance)to managers’ beliefs about what passengers expect fromservice quality at airports, the authors recommend studyingservice quality perceptions in a customer-focused manner inorder to best determine where and how airport service qualityinitiatives can make a signiﬁcant difference to the customer.a key implication, therefore, is a passenger-drivenframework for the airport manager on how to enhance thequality of the service quality management process therebyimproving service quality in the airport in ways that really domatter to the passenger.customer-driven service quality enhancements affect notonly passengers’ perceptions, but also the overallattractiveness of the airport relative to its competitors.consequently, allocating an appropriate amount ofresources to the key factors of airport service quality canincrease the likelihood of being perceived by a passenger asthe best choice, relative to the alternatives available.the study provides strong support for developing anapproach to airport service quality measurement thatsupports managers who need to make informed decisions asto how best to fulﬁll their industry mandate and to achievecompetitive advantage in the marketing.(a pre´cis of the article “passengers’ expectations of airport servicequality”. supplied by marketing
