# Natural language processing: AI Specialisation programme projects

This repo contains all my Natural Language Processing projects, developed for my specialisation programme at Universidad de Buenos Aires Univeristy. Among these projects, you will find:


## 1. Word Vectorisation:

Word vectorisation techniques including:
* Extracting vocabulary
* OneHot Encoding
* Frequency vectors
* TF-IDF
* Cosine Similarity

## 2. Simple Bot:

This simple bot is designed to find and retrieve similar phrases to those found
within a user-defined set of pdf documents using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
TP2 Description

## 3. Gensim Custom Embeddings:




Creation of custom embeddings using Gensim. In this case, using aviation-related vocabulary as obtained from Wikipedia.


## 4. Next Word Prediction:

Next word prediction using LSTM networks. Vocabulary is constructed from 100 randomly picked Wikipedia articles.



## 5. Sentiment Classification:

Sentiment classification of clothing reviews using embeddings and LSTM Networks.


## 6. Q & A Chatbot:

Q&A Chatbot trained using an LSTM Network
