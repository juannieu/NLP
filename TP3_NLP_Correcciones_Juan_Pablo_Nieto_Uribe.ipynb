              "['\\nThe Airbus A320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by Airbus.\\nThe A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.\\nThe first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).\\nFinal assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.\\nThe twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318.\\nThe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\\nVariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5\\xa0t (150,000 to 206,000\\xa0lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940\\xa0km (3,100–3,750\\xa0nmi) range.\\nThe 31.4\\xa0m (103\\xa0ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\\nThe 124-156 seat A319 is 33.8\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft) long.\\nThe A320 is 37.6\\xa0m (123\\xa0ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\\nThe 44.5\\xa0m (146\\xa0ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\\nThe Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions.\\nIn December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016.\\nWith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\\nEarlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).\\nAmerican Airlines is the largest A320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] In October 2019, the A320 family surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. \\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], a total of 16,622 A320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n',\n",

The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n\\n\\nAn airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nThe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nIn colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nThat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nAn international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nSmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nIn the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nThe longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). The world\\'s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nAs of 2009[update], the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nMost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany\\'s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India\\'s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia[citation needed].\\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport[citation needed].\\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nMany US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA[11] under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.\\nDespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nThe Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States.[13] Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA\\'s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.[14] The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nAirports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nAirports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\nA terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. There also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nThe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"Floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nMany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.\\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.\\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nAir traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\\nThe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized ATC stations.\\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nAt all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.\\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nLarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nMany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.\\nPlanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nMost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\nAviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nMany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nAirports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\nAircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\nA growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nThe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi,[38] India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.\\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force\\'s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.\\nAn aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\\nMost airports in the United States are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nAirports are uniquely represented by their IATA airport code and ICAO airport code.\\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).\\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).\\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nThe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris, France was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nBeijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2022.[41]\\nHamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.\\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920.[43] In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nAfter World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Speed, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone (1990), Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers. They have also played important parts in television series like Lost, The Amazing Race, America\\'s Next Top Model (season 10), 90 Day Fiancé, Air Crash Investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. Good Will Hunting.\\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport.

              " '\\nThe Airbus A320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by Airbus.\\nThe A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.\\nThe first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).\\nFinal assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.\\nThe twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318.\\nThe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\\nVariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5\\xa0t (150,000 to 206,000\\xa0lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940\\xa0km (3,100–3,750\\xa0nmi) range.\\nThe 31.4\\xa0m (103\\xa0ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\\nThe 124-156 seat A319 is 33.8\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft) long.\\nThe A320 is 37.6\\xa0m (123\\xa0ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\\nThe 44.5\\xa0m (146\\xa0ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\\nThe Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions.\\nIn December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016.\\nWith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\\nEarlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).\\nAmerican Airlines is the largest A320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] In October 2019, the A320 family surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. \\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], a total of 16,622 A320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n\\n\\nAn airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nThe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nIn colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nThat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nAn international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nSmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nIn the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nThe longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). The world\\'s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nAs of 2009[update], the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nMost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany\\'s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India\\'s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia[citation needed].\\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport[citation needed].\\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nMany US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA[11] under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.\\nDespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nThe Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States.[13] Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA\\'s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.[14] The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nAirports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nAirports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\nA terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. There also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nThe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"Floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nMany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.\\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.\\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nAir traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\\nThe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized ATC stations.\\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nAt all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.\\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nLarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nMany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.\\nPlanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nMost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\nAviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nMany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nAirports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\nAircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\nA growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nThe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi,[38] India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.\\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force\\'s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.\\nAn aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\\nMost airports in the United States are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nAirports are uniquely represented by their IATA airport code and ICAO airport code.\\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).\\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).\\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nThe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris, France was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nBeijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2022.[41]\\nHamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.\\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920.[43] In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nAfter World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Speed, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone (1990), Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers. They have also played important parts in television series like Lost, The Amazing Race, America\\'s Next Top Model (season 10), 90 Day Fiancé, Air Crash Investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. Good Will Hunting.\\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the Airport Tycoon series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.\\nEach civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. This will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby NAVAIDs and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary.\\nInfraero is responsible for the airports in Brazil\\nA comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group Airports Council International.\\nLists:\\nAffiliates\\nAvianca S.A. (acronym in Spanish for Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A., \"Airways of the American Continent\") is a Colombian airline. It has been the flag carrier of Colombia[3][4] since December 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name SCADTA.[5][6] It is headquartered in Colombia, with its registered office in Barranquilla and its global headquarters in Bogotá and main hub at El Dorado International Airport. Avianca is the flagship of a group of ten Latin American airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. Avianca is the largest airline in Colombia and second largest in Latin America, after LATAM of Chile. Avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in Latin America.[7] Prior to the merger with TACA in 2010, it was wholly owned by Synergy Group, a South American holding company established by Germán Efromovich and specialising in air transport. It is listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.[8]\\nThrough SCADTA, Avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after KLM, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2019. It is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere.[9] It became an official member of Star Alliance on June 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement[10] of its invitation to join the alliance.[11] On May 10, 2020, Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in New York City, and liquidated its subsidiary Avianca Perú, due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.[12][13][14]\\nThe airline traces its history back to December 5, 1919, in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the airline), Rafael María Palacio, Cristóbal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and Germans Werner Kämmerer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes Aéreos or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight on \\tSeptember 5, 1920 between Barranquilla and the nearby town of Puerto Colombia using a Junkers F.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850\\xa0km (528\\xa0mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the Junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on October 20, 1920, following the course of the Magdalena River; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and philanthropist Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the Colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in Venezuela and the United States. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned Pan Am.\\nOn June 14, 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline SACO, forming the new Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia S.A. or Avianca. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael María Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as German citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Martín del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA\\'s history as its own.\\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to Quito, Lima, Panama City, Miami, New York City and Europe, using Douglas DC-4s and C-54 Skymasters. In 1951, Avianca acquired Lockheed Constellations and Super Constellations. In 1956, the company transported the Colombian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. \\nDuring the 1960s, the company built the Avianca Building in Bogotá, designed by the architect Germán Samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of Santander Park. In 1961, Avianca leased two Boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on November 2, 1961, it acquired its own Boeing 720s. In 1976, Avianca became the first Latin American airline to continuously operate the Boeing 747-100. Three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two Combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.\\nIn 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the Terminal Puente Aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala. Avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York.[15]\\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier SAM and the helicopter operator Helicol merged, beginning Avianca\\'s new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of Boeing 767s, Boeing 757s, MD-83s, Fokker 50s, and Bell helicopters. In 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\\nOn December 10, 1998, Avianca officially opened its new hub in Bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of Colombian and international travelers between South America, Europe and North America.\\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Avianca, SAM, and their major rival ACES joined efforts to create the Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on May 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. However, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. In November 2003, the Alianza Summa was disbanded, ACES was liquidated altogether and SAM was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca\\'s brand.\\nOn December 10, 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the Brazilian consortium, Synergy Group and the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and VIP. The company\\'s full legal name was changed from Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia (National Airways of Colombia) to Aerovías del Continente Americano (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. On February 28, 2005, Avianca presented its new logo and livery.\\nIn October 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with TACA Airlines.[16][17] This created AviancaTaca Holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\\nIn November 2009, the airline\\'s Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.[18] On January 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318s leased from GECAS. The aircraft were delivered from February to April 2011.\\nOn November 10, 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca (and its merger counterpart, TACA) were full members in 2012. Due to Avianca\\'s entry into Star Alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines and began a new codeshare agreement with United Airlines. TACA had been codesharing with United Airlines since 2006.[19] On June 21, 2012, Avianca and TACA were both officially admitted into Star Alliance.\\nOn March 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from AviancaTaca Holding to Avianca Holdings.[20] TACA and all other AviancaTaca airlines changed their brand to Avianca on May 28, 2013.\\nAs of 2017, Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.\\nIn August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. This resulted in the cancellation of several flights within Colombia. Likewise, due to the stoppage of ACDAC pilots in 2017, only in October 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.\\nOn March 1, 2019, Avianca launched a subsidiary named Avianca Express, which operates ATR-72s on short regional flights within Colombia.[21]\\nAvianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. Because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on December 31, 2019. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended Avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late March and May outside of repatriation missions. As a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed.\\nAvianca Holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. The airline holding liquidated their subsidiary Avianca Perú the same day. The debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-11133. The airline had accumulated a total debt of USD $7.3 billion at the end of 2019.[22]\\nAvianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their Airbus A320s, simplifying their fleet to only the A320 family and Boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.[23][24]\\nIn November 2021, Avianca Holdings announced they would move their legal address from Panama to the United Kingdom, and that they would change their name to Avianca Group.[25] Their global headquarters remains in Bogotá. On November 2, 2021, Avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court,[26] and on December 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, Avianca emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.[27]\\nOn April 29, 2022, Avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor Viva Air Colombia and its subsidiary Viva Air Perú.[28][29]\\nOn May 11, 2022, it was announced that Avianca would merge with Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes to form the Abra Group, and that Avianca will be the acquiring company.[30][31]\\nAvianca\\'s headquarters are on Avenida El Dorado and between Carrera 60 and Gobernación de Cundinamarca, located in the Ciudad Salitre area of Bogotá. The building is located next to the Gran Estación.[32] Its previous head office was at Avenida El Dorado No. 93-30.[33]\\nAvianca\\'s hubs are in Bogotá, San Salvador, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín. Its focus cities are Barranquilla, San José, and Miami, in the latter of which Avianca is the largest foreign carrier by number of passengers.\\nAvianca has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[34]\\nAvianca has an interline agreement with Boliviana de Aviación.[35]\\nThe frequent-flyer program of Avianca and its subsidiaries is LifeMiles. This program is designed to reward customer loyalty for the Airline, Travel, and Retail sectors. LifeMiles members can earn miles every time they fly with Avianca, Star Alliance member airlines, GOL Airlines, Aeromexico, and Iberia. \\nThe program was launched in 2011, as the merger of Avianca and TACA, replacing its former program AviancaPlus. LifeMiles has been awarded 14 Freddie Awards for it\\'s outstanding performance and best promotions in the Americas during the last 9 years.\\nLifeMiles has four Elite Tiers:\\nAs of October\\xa02022[update], the Avianca fleet consists of the following aircraft:[1][36]\\nAvianca\\'s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner was delivered on December 17, 2014, and launched its first service on January 16, 2015, between Bogotá and New York City.[39][40]\\nOver the years, Avianca had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:[41][42][43]\\nThe airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. The deadliest of those incidents was Avianca Flight 011, which crashed in 1983.\\nIn its recent history, the company has won different awards:[62]\\n Media related to Avianca at Wikimedia Commons\\n',\n",
              " '\\nThe Airbus A320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by Airbus.\\nThe A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.\\nThe first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).\\nFinal assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.\\nThe twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318.\\nThe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\\nVariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5\\xa0t (150,000 to 206,000\\xa0lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940\\xa0km (3,100–3,750\\xa0nmi) range.\\nThe 31.4\\xa0m (103\\xa0ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\\nThe 124-156 seat A319 is 33.8\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft) long.\\nThe A320 is 37.6\\xa0m (123\\xa0ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\\nThe 44.5\\xa0m (146\\xa0ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\\nThe Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions.\\nIn December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016.\\nWith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\\nEarlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).\\nAmerican Airlines is the largest A320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] In October 2019, the A320 family surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. \\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], a total of 16,622 A320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n\\n\\nAn airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nThe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nIn colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nThat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nAn international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nSmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nIn the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nThe longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). The world\\'s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nAs of 2009[update], the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nMost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany\\'s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India\\'s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia[citation needed].\\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport[citation needed].\\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nMany US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA[11] under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.\\nDespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nThe Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States.[13] Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA\\'s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.[14] The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nAirports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nAirports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\nA terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. There also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nThe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"Floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nMany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.\\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.\\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nAir traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\\nThe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized ATC stations.\\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nAt all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.\\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nLarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nMany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.\\nPlanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nMost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\nAviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nMany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nAirports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\nAircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\nA growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nThe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi,[38] India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.\\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force\\'s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.\\nAn aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\\nMost airports in the United States are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nAirports are uniquely represented by their IATA airport code and ICAO airport code.\\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).\\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).\\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nThe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris, France was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nBeijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2022.[41]\\nHamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.\\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920.[43] In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nAfter World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Speed, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone (1990), Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers. They have also played important parts in television series like Lost, The Amazing Race, America\\'s Next Top Model (season 10), 90 Day Fiancé, Air Crash Investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. Good Will Hunting.\\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the Airport Tycoon series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.\\nEach civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. This will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby NAVAIDs and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary.\\nInfraero is responsible for the airports in Brazil\\nA comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group Airports Council International.\\nLists:\\nAffiliates\\nAvianca S.A. (acronym in Spanish for Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A., \"Airways of the American Continent\") is a Colombian airline. It has been the flag carrier of Colombia[3][4] since December 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name SCADTA.[5][6] It is headquartered in Colombia, with its registered office in Barranquilla and its global headquarters in Bogotá and main hub at El Dorado International Airport. Avianca is the flagship of a group of ten Latin American airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. Avianca is the largest airline in Colombia and second largest in Latin America, after LATAM of Chile. Avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in Latin America.[7] Prior to the merger with TACA in 2010, it was wholly owned by Synergy Group, a South American holding company established by Germán Efromovich and specialising in air transport. It is listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.[8]\\nThrough SCADTA, Avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after KLM, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2019. It is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere.[9] It became an official member of Star Alliance on June 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement[10] of its invitation to join the alliance.[11] On May 10, 2020, Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in New York City, and liquidated its subsidiary Avianca Perú, due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.[12][13][14]\\nThe airline traces its history back to December 5, 1919, in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the airline), Rafael María Palacio, Cristóbal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and Germans Werner Kämmerer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes Aéreos or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight on \\tSeptember 5, 1920 between Barranquilla and the nearby town of Puerto Colombia using a Junkers F.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850\\xa0km (528\\xa0mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the Junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on October 20, 1920, following the course of the Magdalena River; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and philanthropist Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the Colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in Venezuela and the United States. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned Pan Am.\\nOn June 14, 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline SACO, forming the new Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia S.A. or Avianca. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael María Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as German citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Martín del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA\\'s history as its own.\\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to Quito, Lima, Panama City, Miami, New York City and Europe, using Douglas DC-4s and C-54 Skymasters. In 1951, Avianca acquired Lockheed Constellations and Super Constellations. In 1956, the company transported the Colombian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. \\nDuring the 1960s, the company built the Avianca Building in Bogotá, designed by the architect Germán Samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of Santander Park. In 1961, Avianca leased two Boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on November 2, 1961, it acquired its own Boeing 720s. In 1976, Avianca became the first Latin American airline to continuously operate the Boeing 747-100. Three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two Combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.\\nIn 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the Terminal Puente Aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala. Avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York.[15]\\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier SAM and the helicopter operator Helicol merged, beginning Avianca\\'s new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of Boeing 767s, Boeing 757s, MD-83s, Fokker 50s, and Bell helicopters. In 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\\nOn December 10, 1998, Avianca officially opened its new hub in Bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of Colombian and international travelers between South America, Europe and North America.\\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Avianca, SAM, and their major rival ACES joined efforts to create the Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on May 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. However, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. In November 2003, the Alianza Summa was disbanded, ACES was liquidated altogether and SAM was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca\\'s brand.\\nOn December 10, 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the Brazilian consortium, Synergy Group and the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and VIP. The company\\'s full legal name was changed from Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia (National Airways of Colombia) to Aerovías del Continente Americano (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. On February 28, 2005, Avianca presented its new logo and livery.\\nIn October 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with TACA Airlines.[16][17] This created AviancaTaca Holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\\nIn November 2009, the airline\\'s Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.[18] On January 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318s leased from GECAS. The aircraft were delivered from February to April 2011.\\nOn November 10, 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca (and its merger counterpart, TACA) were full members in 2012. Due to Avianca\\'s entry into Star Alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines and began a new codeshare agreement with United Airlines. TACA had been codesharing with United Airlines since 2006.[19] On June 21, 2012, Avianca and TACA were both officially admitted into Star Alliance.\\nOn March 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from AviancaTaca Holding to Avianca Holdings.[20] TACA and all other AviancaTaca airlines changed their brand to Avianca on May 28, 2013.\\nAs of 2017, Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.\\nIn August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. This resulted in the cancellation of several flights within Colombia. Likewise, due to the stoppage of ACDAC pilots in 2017, only in October 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.\\nOn March 1, 2019, Avianca launched a subsidiary named Avianca Express, which operates ATR-72s on short regional flights within Colombia.[21]\\nAvianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. Because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on December 31, 2019. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended Avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late March and May outside of repatriation missions. As a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed.\\nAvianca Holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. The airline holding liquidated their subsidiary Avianca Perú the same day. The debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-11133. The airline had accumulated a total debt of USD $7.3 billion at the end of 2019.[22]\\nAvianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their Airbus A320s, simplifying their fleet to only the A320 family and Boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.[23][24]\\nIn November 2021, Avianca Holdings announced they would move their legal address from Panama to the United Kingdom, and that they would change their name to Avianca Group.[25] Their global headquarters remains in Bogotá. On November 2, 2021, Avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court,[26] and on December 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, Avianca emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.[27]\\nOn April 29, 2022, Avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor Viva Air Colombia and its subsidiary Viva Air Perú.[28][29]\\nOn May 11, 2022, it was announced that Avianca would merge with Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes to form the Abra Group, and that Avianca will be the acquiring company.[30][31]\\nAvianca\\'s headquarters are on Avenida El Dorado and between Carrera 60 and Gobernación de Cundinamarca, located in the Ciudad Salitre area of Bogotá. The building is located next to the Gran Estación.[32] Its previous head office was at Avenida El Dorado No. 93-30.[33]\\nAvianca\\'s hubs are in Bogotá, San Salvador, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín. Its focus cities are Barranquilla, San José, and Miami, in the latter of which Avianca is the largest foreign carrier by number of passengers.\\nAvianca has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[34]\\nAvianca has an interline agreement with Boliviana de Aviación.[35]\\nThe frequent-flyer program of Avianca and its subsidiaries is LifeMiles. This program is designed to reward customer loyalty for the Airline, Travel, and Retail sectors. LifeMiles members can earn miles every time they fly with Avianca, Star Alliance member airlines, GOL Airlines, Aeromexico, and Iberia. \\nThe program was launched in 2011, as the merger of Avianca and TACA, replacing its former program AviancaPlus. LifeMiles has been awarded 14 Freddie Awards for it\\'s outstanding performance and best promotions in the Americas during the last 9 years.\\nLifeMiles has four Elite Tiers:\\nAs of October\\xa02022[update], the Avianca fleet consists of the following aircraft:[1][36]\\nAvianca\\'s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner was delivered on December 17, 2014, and launched its first service on January 16, 2015, between Bogotá and New York City.[39][40]\\nOver the years, Avianca had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:[41][42][43]\\nThe airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. The deadliest of those incidents was Avianca Flight 011, which crashed in 1983.\\nIn its recent history, the company has won different awards:[62]\\n Media related to Avianca at Wikimedia Commons\\nFlight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight).  This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.\\nMany things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.\\nThe engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.\\nHumans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in air.\\nAn aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. An aerostat\\'s main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas[1][2] to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached.\\nAerostats are so named because they use \"aerostatic\" lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass.\\nSome things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. This is termed gliding. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. This is termed soaring. However most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. This is termed powered flight.\\nThe only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals.[3] Each of these groups\\' wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight.[4] The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods.[3]\\nBats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see bat flight).[5] However, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. Flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. \"Flying\" snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.\\nFlying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.[6]\\nMost birds fly (see bird flight), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the Phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of South America in the Cenozoic era.  The non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.[citation needed] Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.\\nAmong living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 meters (11 feet); the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at 21 kilograms (46 pounds).[7]\\nMost species of insects can fly as adults. Insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips.[8][9]\\nMechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. These machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. Gliders are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.\\nSupersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground,[10] and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.\\nHypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle and Soyuz.\\nSome things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ballistic flight. Examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc.\\nEssentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc.\\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.[11] Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\nIn 2018, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an \"ionic wind\" also known as electroaerodynamic thrust.[12][13]\\nMany human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears,[14][15] the\\nboomerang in Australia, the hot air Kongming lantern, and kites.\\nGeorge Cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century,[16][17][18] and in the second half of the 19th century Otto Lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. His work was replicated and extended by the Wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.[19]\\nSpaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard. The first orbital spaceflight was in 1957,[20] and Yuri Gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961.[21]\\nThere are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. A heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding.\\nSome vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example rockets and Harrier Jump Jets.\\nFinally, momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.\\nForces relevant to flight are[22]\\nThese forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.\\nA fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine.[23]  The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.\\nIn the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction.[24] Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with Newton\\'s third law of motion.\\nLift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word \"lift\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\\nFor a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement.[25][26][27][28] Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.\\nAerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\\nHowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced \"L over D ratio.\" An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD.[29]\\nThe lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\\n[30]\\nThe drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] \\n[31]\\nLift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.\\nLift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.[32]\\nAir pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - Archimedes\\' principle holds for air just as it does for water.\\nA cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\\nThrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the Earth\\'s standard acceleration \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ng\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle g_{0}}\\n\\n).[33] It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft).\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in gs), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible.\\nFlight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle\\'s center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (See Tait-Bryan rotations for an explanation).\\nThe control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. \"a tail\"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive dihedral angle\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\\nTo create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.\\nPropulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.[34][35]\\nThe range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.[36]\\nFor powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used.\\nAll animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.\\nVehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\\nNavigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, GPS, LORAN, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter).\\nIn aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground.\\nThe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (VFR) or the instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\\nA guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\\nA conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft\\'s direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\\nIn the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems.\\nCollision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\\nAir safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\\n Flight travel guide from Wikivoyage\\n',\n",
              " '\\nThe Airbus A320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by Airbus.\\nThe A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.\\nThe first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).\\nFinal assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.\\nThe twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318.\\nThe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\\nVariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5\\xa0t (150,000 to 206,000\\xa0lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940\\xa0km (3,100–3,750\\xa0nmi) range.\\nThe 31.4\\xa0m (103\\xa0ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\\nThe 124-156 seat A319 is 33.8\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft) long.\\nThe A320 is 37.6\\xa0m (123\\xa0ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\\nThe 44.5\\xa0m (146\\xa0ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\\nThe Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions.\\nIn December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016.\\nWith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\\nEarlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).\\nAmerican Airlines is the largest A320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] In October 2019, the A320 family surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. \\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], a total of 16,622 A320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n\\n\\nAn airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nThe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nIn colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nThat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nAn international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nSmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nIn the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nThe longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). The world\\'s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nAs of 2009[update], the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nMost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany\\'s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India\\'s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia[citation needed].\\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport[citation needed].\\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nMany US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA[11] under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.\\nDespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nThe Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States.[13] Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA\\'s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.[14] The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nAirports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nAirports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\nA terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. There also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nThe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"Floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nMany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.\\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.\\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nAir traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\\nThe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized ATC stations.\\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nAt all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.\\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nLarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nMany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.\\nPlanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nMost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\nAviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nMany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nAirports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\nAircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\nA growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nThe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi,[38] India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.\\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force\\'s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.\\nAn aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\\nMost airports in the United States are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nAirports are uniquely represented by their IATA airport code and ICAO airport code.\\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).\\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).\\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nThe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris, France was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nBeijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2022.[41]\\nHamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.\\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920.[43] In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nAfter World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Speed, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone (1990), Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers. They have also played important parts in television series like Lost, The Amazing Race, America\\'s Next Top Model (season 10), 90 Day Fiancé, Air Crash Investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. Good Will Hunting.\\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the Airport Tycoon series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.\\nEach civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. This will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby NAVAIDs and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary.\\nInfraero is responsible for the airports in Brazil\\nA comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group Airports Council International.\\nLists:\\nAffiliates\\nAvianca S.A. (acronym in Spanish for Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A., \"Airways of the American Continent\") is a Colombian airline. It has been the flag carrier of Colombia[3][4] since December 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name SCADTA.[5][6] It is headquartered in Colombia, with its registered office in Barranquilla and its global headquarters in Bogotá and main hub at El Dorado International Airport. Avianca is the flagship of a group of ten Latin American airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. Avianca is the largest airline in Colombia and second largest in Latin America, after LATAM of Chile. Avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in Latin America.[7] Prior to the merger with TACA in 2010, it was wholly owned by Synergy Group, a South American holding company established by Germán Efromovich and specialising in air transport. It is listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.[8]\\nThrough SCADTA, Avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after KLM, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2019. It is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere.[9] It became an official member of Star Alliance on June 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement[10] of its invitation to join the alliance.[11] On May 10, 2020, Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in New York City, and liquidated its subsidiary Avianca Perú, due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.[12][13][14]\\nThe airline traces its history back to December 5, 1919, in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the airline), Rafael María Palacio, Cristóbal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and Germans Werner Kämmerer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes Aéreos or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight on \\tSeptember 5, 1920 between Barranquilla and the nearby town of Puerto Colombia using a Junkers F.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850\\xa0km (528\\xa0mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the Junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on October 20, 1920, following the course of the Magdalena River; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and philanthropist Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the Colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in Venezuela and the United States. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned Pan Am.\\nOn June 14, 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline SACO, forming the new Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia S.A. or Avianca. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael María Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as German citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Martín del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA\\'s history as its own.\\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to Quito, Lima, Panama City, Miami, New York City and Europe, using Douglas DC-4s and C-54 Skymasters. In 1951, Avianca acquired Lockheed Constellations and Super Constellations. In 1956, the company transported the Colombian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. \\nDuring the 1960s, the company built the Avianca Building in Bogotá, designed by the architect Germán Samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of Santander Park. In 1961, Avianca leased two Boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on November 2, 1961, it acquired its own Boeing 720s. In 1976, Avianca became the first Latin American airline to continuously operate the Boeing 747-100. Three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two Combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.\\nIn 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the Terminal Puente Aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala. Avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York.[15]\\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier SAM and the helicopter operator Helicol merged, beginning Avianca\\'s new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of Boeing 767s, Boeing 757s, MD-83s, Fokker 50s, and Bell helicopters. In 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\\nOn December 10, 1998, Avianca officially opened its new hub in Bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of Colombian and international travelers between South America, Europe and North America.\\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Avianca, SAM, and their major rival ACES joined efforts to create the Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on May 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. However, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. In November 2003, the Alianza Summa was disbanded, ACES was liquidated altogether and SAM was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca\\'s brand.\\nOn December 10, 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the Brazilian consortium, Synergy Group and the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and VIP. The company\\'s full legal name was changed from Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia (National Airways of Colombia) to Aerovías del Continente Americano (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. On February 28, 2005, Avianca presented its new logo and livery.\\nIn October 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with TACA Airlines.[16][17] This created AviancaTaca Holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\\nIn November 2009, the airline\\'s Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.[18] On January 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318s leased from GECAS. The aircraft were delivered from February to April 2011.\\nOn November 10, 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca (and its merger counterpart, TACA) were full members in 2012. Due to Avianca\\'s entry into Star Alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines and began a new codeshare agreement with United Airlines. TACA had been codesharing with United Airlines since 2006.[19] On June 21, 2012, Avianca and TACA were both officially admitted into Star Alliance.\\nOn March 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from AviancaTaca Holding to Avianca Holdings.[20] TACA and all other AviancaTaca airlines changed their brand to Avianca on May 28, 2013.\\nAs of 2017, Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.\\nIn August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. This resulted in the cancellation of several flights within Colombia. Likewise, due to the stoppage of ACDAC pilots in 2017, only in October 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.\\nOn March 1, 2019, Avianca launched a subsidiary named Avianca Express, which operates ATR-72s on short regional flights within Colombia.[21]\\nAvianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. Because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on December 31, 2019. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended Avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late March and May outside of repatriation missions. As a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed.\\nAvianca Holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. The airline holding liquidated their subsidiary Avianca Perú the same day. The debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-11133. The airline had accumulated a total debt of USD $7.3 billion at the end of 2019.[22]\\nAvianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their Airbus A320s, simplifying their fleet to only the A320 family and Boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.[23][24]\\nIn November 2021, Avianca Holdings announced they would move their legal address from Panama to the United Kingdom, and that they would change their name to Avianca Group.[25] Their global headquarters remains in Bogotá. On November 2, 2021, Avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court,[26] and on December 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, Avianca emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.[27]\\nOn April 29, 2022, Avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor Viva Air Colombia and its subsidiary Viva Air Perú.[28][29]\\nOn May 11, 2022, it was announced that Avianca would merge with Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes to form the Abra Group, and that Avianca will be the acquiring company.[30][31]\\nAvianca\\'s headquarters are on Avenida El Dorado and between Carrera 60 and Gobernación de Cundinamarca, located in the Ciudad Salitre area of Bogotá. The building is located next to the Gran Estación.[32] Its previous head office was at Avenida El Dorado No. 93-30.[33]\\nAvianca\\'s hubs are in Bogotá, San Salvador, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín. Its focus cities are Barranquilla, San José, and Miami, in the latter of which Avianca is the largest foreign carrier by number of passengers.\\nAvianca has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[34]\\nAvianca has an interline agreement with Boliviana de Aviación.[35]\\nThe frequent-flyer program of Avianca and its subsidiaries is LifeMiles. This program is designed to reward customer loyalty for the Airline, Travel, and Retail sectors. LifeMiles members can earn miles every time they fly with Avianca, Star Alliance member airlines, GOL Airlines, Aeromexico, and Iberia. \\nThe program was launched in 2011, as the merger of Avianca and TACA, replacing its former program AviancaPlus. LifeMiles has been awarded 14 Freddie Awards for it\\'s outstanding performance and best promotions in the Americas during the last 9 years.\\nLifeMiles has four Elite Tiers:\\nAs of October\\xa02022[update], the Avianca fleet consists of the following aircraft:[1][36]\\nAvianca\\'s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner was delivered on December 17, 2014, and launched its first service on January 16, 2015, between Bogotá and New York City.[39][40]\\nOver the years, Avianca had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:[41][42][43]\\nThe airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. The deadliest of those incidents was Avianca Flight 011, which crashed in 1983.\\nIn its recent history, the company has won different awards:[62]\\n Media related to Avianca at Wikimedia Commons\\nFlight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight).  This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.\\nMany things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.\\nThe engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.\\nHumans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in air.\\nAn aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. An aerostat\\'s main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas[1][2] to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached.\\nAerostats are so named because they use \"aerostatic\" lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass.\\nSome things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. This is termed gliding. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. This is termed soaring. However most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. This is termed powered flight.\\nThe only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals.[3] Each of these groups\\' wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight.[4] The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods.[3]\\nBats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see bat flight).[5] However, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. Flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. \"Flying\" snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.\\nFlying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.[6]\\nMost birds fly (see bird flight), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the Phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of South America in the Cenozoic era.  The non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.[citation needed] Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.\\nAmong living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 meters (11 feet); the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at 21 kilograms (46 pounds).[7]\\nMost species of insects can fly as adults. Insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips.[8][9]\\nMechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. These machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. Gliders are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.\\nSupersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground,[10] and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.\\nHypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle and Soyuz.\\nSome things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ballistic flight. Examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc.\\nEssentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc.\\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.[11] Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\nIn 2018, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an \"ionic wind\" also known as electroaerodynamic thrust.[12][13]\\nMany human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears,[14][15] the\\nboomerang in Australia, the hot air Kongming lantern, and kites.\\nGeorge Cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century,[16][17][18] and in the second half of the 19th century Otto Lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. His work was replicated and extended by the Wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.[19]\\nSpaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard. The first orbital spaceflight was in 1957,[20] and Yuri Gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961.[21]\\nThere are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. A heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding.\\nSome vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example rockets and Harrier Jump Jets.\\nFinally, momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.\\nForces relevant to flight are[22]\\nThese forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.\\nA fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine.[23]  The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.\\nIn the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction.[24] Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with Newton\\'s third law of motion.\\nLift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word \"lift\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\\nFor a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement.[25][26][27][28] Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.\\nAerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\\nHowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced \"L over D ratio.\" An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD.[29]\\nThe lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\\n[30]\\nThe drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] \\n[31]\\nLift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.\\nLift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.[32]\\nAir pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - Archimedes\\' principle holds for air just as it does for water.\\nA cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\\nThrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the Earth\\'s standard acceleration \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ng\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle g_{0}}\\n\\n).[33] It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft).\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in gs), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible.\\nFlight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle\\'s center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (See Tait-Bryan rotations for an explanation).\\nThe control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. \"a tail\"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive dihedral angle\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\\nTo create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.\\nPropulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.[34][35]\\nThe range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.[36]\\nFor powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used.\\nAll animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.\\nVehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\\nNavigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, GPS, LORAN, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter).\\nIn aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground.\\nThe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (VFR) or the instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\\nA guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\\nA conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft\\'s direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\\nIn the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems.\\nCollision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\\nAir safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\\n Flight travel guide from Wikivoyage\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the largest transportation agency of the U.S. government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country as well as over surrounding international waters.[3]:\\u200a12,\\u200a16\\u200a Its powers include air traffic management, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of U.S. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\\nCreated in August\\xa01958\\xa0(1958-08), the FAA replaced the former Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and later became an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation.\\nThe FAA\\'s roles include:\\nThe FAA operates five \"lines of business\".[4] Their functions are:\\nThe FAA is headquartered in Washington, D.C.[10] and also operates the William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for support and research, and the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for training. The FAA has nine regional administrative offices:\\nThe Air Commerce Act of May 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the federal government\\'s regulation of civil aviation. This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\\nIn fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation\\'s system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications—before the founding of the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today—and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\\nThe Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\\nIn 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also expanded the government\\'s role by giving the CAA the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.\\nOn the eve of America\\'s entry into World War II, CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation\\'s civil airports.\\nThe approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions—most notably the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation passed the CAA\\'s functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act also transferred air safety regulation from the CAB to the FAA, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA\\'s first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former Air Force general and adviser to President Eisenhower.\\nThe same year witnessed the birth of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which was created in response to the Soviet Union (USSR) launch of the first manmade satellite.  NASA assumed NACA\\'s aeronautical research role.\\nIn 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency\\'s name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT. The FAA administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.\\nAt the same time, a new National Transportation Safety Board took over the Civil Aeronautics Board\\'s (CAB) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. CAB was merged into DOT with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.\\nThe FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security. The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. During the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.\\nBy the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 phased out the CAB\\'s economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In 1994, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.[11]\\nIn 1979, Congress authorized the FAA to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. Throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.\\nIn the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the FAA\\'s development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. In 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within DOT headquarters. The agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the September 11 attacks.\\nIn December 2000, an organization within the FAA called the Air Traffic Organization,[12] (ATO) was set up by presidential executive order. This became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the United States and for the New York (Atlantic) and Oakland (Pacific) oceanic areas. It is a full member of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation.\\nThe FAA issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. Among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the AMT Awards), a flight instructor (Gold Seal certification), a 50-year aviator (Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award), a 50-year mechanic (Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award) or as a proficient pilot. The latter, the FAA \"WINGS Program\", provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (Basic, Advanced, and Master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last WINGS award, or \"Phase\". For more information on all these programs, visit www.faasafety.gov or inquire at an FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  For more information on the WINGS program, please see FAA Advisory Circular AC 61-91J.\\nThe FAA encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety.  The FAA Safety Team, or FAASTeam, works with Volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide.  For more information, inquire at an FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).\\nOn March 18, 2008, the FAA ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that Southwest Airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections.[13] The FAA exercises surprise Red Team drills on national airports annually.\\nOn October 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism [14] from Nick Bilton of The New York Times,[15][16] the FAA announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). Implementation initially varied among airlines. The FAA expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. From a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft\\'s high speed. However, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.[17]\\nIn July 2014, in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the FAA suspended flights by U.S. airlines to Ben Gurion Airport during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict for 24 hours. The ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later.[18]\\nThe FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 gives the FAA one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers.[19][20][21]\\nThe first FAA licensed orbital human space flight took place on November 15, 2020, carried out by SpaceX on behalf of NASA.[22][23]\\nThe administrator is appointed for a five-year term.\\nOn March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Stephen Dickson, a former executive and pilot at Delta Air Lines, to be the next FAA Administrator.[30][26][27] On July 24, 2019, the Senate confirmed Dickson by a vote of 52–40.[31][32] He was sworn in as Administrator by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on August 12, 2019.[32] On February 16, 2022, Dickson announced his resignation as FAA Administrator, effective March 31, 2022.[33]\\nThe FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\"[34] Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz, who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security, is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA. Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: \"Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At $25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\"[35] Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.\\nOn July 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the Southwest Airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the House to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year \"cooling off\" period that FAA inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated.[36][37] The bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word \"customer\" properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the FAA.[36] The bill died in a Senate committee that year.[38]\\nIn September 2009, the FAA administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term \"customers\" to refer to only the flying public.[39]\\nIn 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe \"Bobby\" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline.[40] This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations.[36] The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules.[40] Oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the FAA\\'s culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption\".[40] In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks,[35] and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.[41]\\nIn 2014, the FAA modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. It launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or VRA bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands have been picked up, including veterans, CTI grads, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires. The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program. Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an FAA Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.\\nIn the process of promoting diversity, the FAA revised its hiring process.[42][43] The FAA later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. However, the \"Bio-Q\" was not the determinating factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised Air Traffic Standardized Aptitude Test (ATSAT). Due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised ATSAT, which has since been validated. In 2015 Fox News levied unsubstantiated criticism that the FAA discriminated against qualified candidates.[44]\\nIn December 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the FAA seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under FAA rules before they were abruptly changed. The prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the FAA is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the CTI program.[45]\\nA May 2017 letter from staff of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including NextGen. The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the National Research Council noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).[46][47]\\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.[48][49] A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. The result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. Complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit.[50]\\nAs a result of the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but the FAA declined to ground MAX 8 aircraft operating in the U.S.[51] On March 12, the FAA said that its ongoing review showed \"no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\"[52] Some U.S. Senators called for the FAA to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete.[52] U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that \"If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.\"[53] The FAA resisted grounding the aircraft until March 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. By then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane,[54] and by March 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. Three major U.S. airlines--Southwest, United, and American Airlines—were affected by this decision.[55]\\nFurther investigations also revealed that the FAA and Boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the FAA had retaliated against whistleblowers.[56]\\nA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 CFR section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (IC).[57] The DER system enables the FAA to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the FAA.[58] Qualifications and policies for appointment of Designated Airworthiness Representatives are established in FAA Order 8100.8, Designee Management Handbook. Working procedures for DERs are prescribed in FAA Order 8110.37, Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Handbook.\\nNeither type of DER is an employee of either the FAA or the United States government. While a DER represents the FAA when acting under the authority of a DER appointment; a DER has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a DER. Neither does the FAA provide any indemnification for a DER from general tort law. \"The FAA cannot shelter or protect DERs from the consequences of their findings.\"[59]\\nA DAR[60] is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 CFR 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. There are two types of DARs: manufacturing, and maintenance.\\nSpecialized Experience\\xa0– Amateur-Built and Light-Sport Aircraft DARs Both Manufacturing DARs and Maintenance DARs may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. DAR qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in Order 8100.8.\\nA Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (commonly abbreviated as CANIC) is a notification from the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions.[61]\\n\\nThe FAA Airworthiness Directives Manual,[62] states the following:8. Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC).\\nThe FAA issued a CANIC to state the continued airworthiness of the Boeing 737 MAX, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.[63][64][65][66]\\n\\nAnother CANIC notified the ungrounding of the MAX, ending a 20-month grounding.[67]U.S. law requires that the FAA\\'s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. On July 18, 2016, President Obama signed a second short-term extension of the FAA authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day.[68]\\nThe 2016 extension (set to expire itself in September 2017) left out a provision pushed by Republican House leadership, including House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA). The provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the FAA to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, have done.[69] Shuster\\'s bill, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act,[70] expired in the House at the end of the 114th Congress.[71]\\nThe House T&I Committee began the new reauthorization process for the FAA in February 2017. It is expected that the committee will again urge Congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. Shuster has additional support from President Trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the U.S. air control system is \"....totally out of whack.\"[72]\\n']"

The global A320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing\\'s response to the A320neo.\\nWhen Airbus designed the A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas), two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[5] Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[6] A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[7] It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.\\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and DC-9.[8] Germany\\'s MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Spain\\'s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[9] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nThe design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nIn June 1977 a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme was set up, established by British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale, Dornier and Fokker.[11][12] It was based at the then BAe (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.[13] This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s.[8] It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than the Boeing 737).[8] The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the JET programme, Derek Brown.[9] The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3.[8] Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.[9] The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa.[8][13] However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nIn February 1981 the project was re-designated A320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] The -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0L (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] They would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to Boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses.[13]\\nFrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious.[13] The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by BAe and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] On 1 March 1984, the British government and BAe agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the A320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nIn 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by Flight International,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.[16] At the time, Airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a Air France was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 Paris Air Show.[18] In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] Cyprus Airways became the first customer to place an order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, and then Inex Adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a One of the most significant orders occurred when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, powered by CFM56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nDuring A320 development, Airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by Lufthansa.[13] At the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, Airbus stuck with turbofans.\\nPower on the A320 was to be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kN).[14] It was the only engine available until the arrival of the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kN),[20] hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.[21]\\nIn the presence of then-French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at Toulouse on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] The flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was awarded on 26 February 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March,[23] and began commercial service on 8 April with a flight between Paris and Berlin via Düsseldorf.[24] In 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion French francs.[25]\\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[9][26] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] The aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the A321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the A320 overall.[9][29][30] The length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nFinal assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[31] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the Germans, who argued that it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] An additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the European Investment Bank and private investors.[9]\\nThe maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\\nThe A319 was the following derivative of the baseline A320. The design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus focused once more on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers.[32] Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B, or V2500-A5, derated to 98\\xa0kN (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kN (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993;[32][9][6] the A319\\'s first customer was ILFC, which signed for six aircraft. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 underwent final assembly at Airbus\\' German plant in Hamburg, where A321s were also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. Certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month.[9]\\nDelivery of the first A319, to Swissair, occurred on 25 April 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] The A319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[9] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000;[9][35] with the MTOW of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kN (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kN (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] Range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] Both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in China.[9]\\nSimultaneously, Airbus was developing the Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, and Airbus officially announced the A318[9] at that year\\'s Farnborough Airshow.[6] The aircraft was the smallest in Airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[36]\\nThe 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.[37] Tests on the lead engine, the PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members.[38] After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.[38] On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.[39] Airbus produced a total of 42 A320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nAs Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the US before 2027.[41]\\nIn June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.[42] By January 2019, Mobile was outputting 4.5 A320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nIn September 2019, Airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th A320-family aircraft to Easyjet. In October 2019, Airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] Production rates continue to rise, and Airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and Airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 A320s.[46]\\nIn October 2020, the 500th A320 built in Tianjin, an A320neo, was delivered to China Southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nEngine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion[49] and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).[50]\\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.[51] The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed]\\nDespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[53]\\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year.[55] The 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[56]\\nIn December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the Airbus A320neo.[57]\\nThe first sharklet-equipped Airbus A320 was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] It offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as LEDs for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (PSU).[60]\\nOffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, making its first flight on 25 September 2014 and introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. Its three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family was renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\\nIn 2006, Airbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".[63] The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A30X. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nAfter the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nAirbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the V2500-powered A320.[66]\\nA 150-seat A320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City), or 2.43\\xa0L/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/L fuel.[67]\\nIts wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nThe A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nThe A320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. It is also equipped with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 has an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. The only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nSince 2003, the A320 has featured liquid crystal display (LCD) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nAirbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.[70] Digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nThe A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nThe A320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.[73] At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nAll following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. For Roger Béteille, then Airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nEarly A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010.[74] In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nThe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the A320ceo family were CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney\\'s PW6000 engines available only for the A318,[76] while for the A320neo family are CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines.\\nThe CFM56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nThe IAE V2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nThe PW6000 is available on the smallest A318.\\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market on 18 April 1988 with Air France, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], the global A320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the Boeing 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer\\'s E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier[79] to the A318/A319.\\nAirbus has delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[4] In comparison, Boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since March 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 December 2018).[81]\\nBy September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus expected to deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022.\\nAirbus sold the A320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable.\\nThe six-month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX.\\nThe A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.[82]\\n\\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,[36] to 220, on the A321.[30] They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.[4]\\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA).[85] With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\\nThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0October\\xa02015[update].\\nIn 2018, the A318 list price was US$77.4 million.[86]\\nThe A319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the A320.[29][32][33]\\nAlso known as the A320M-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. With a similar fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[33] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kN) IAE V2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kN) CFM56.[6] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\\'s lower MTOW.\\nThe A319 was developed at the request of Steven F. Udvar-Házy, the former president and CEO of ILFC.[88] The A319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.[9] Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995[14] and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\\nA total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] A 1998 A319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nIn 2018, the A319 list price was US$92.3 million.[86]\\nThe A319CJ (rebranded the ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] Range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319.\\nThe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Services Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737-700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier\\'s Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d\\'Entraînement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France\\'s officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany\\'s officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia,[93] Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy,[94] Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.[9] These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter\\xa0–  later acquired by Air France\\xa0–  and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nThe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\nPowered by two CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kN (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the A320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nIn 1988, the value of a new A320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the A320neo.[96]\\nIn 2018, its list price was US$101.0 million.[86]\\nAs the A320 was beginning operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.[14] The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\\nAs the A321-100 range was less than the A320, development of the heavier and longer range A321-200 began in 1995. The higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0L (790\\xa0US\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] Its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0L (7,930\\xa0US\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997.\\nThe A321\\'s closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER,[95] and the 757-200.[28] A total 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.[4] In 2018, the A321 list price was US$118.3 million.[86]\\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\nOn 17 June 2015 ST Aerospace signed agreements with Airbus and EFW for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.[98]\\nIn August 2019, Qantas was announced as the launch operator for the A321P2F converted freighter, for Australia Post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in October 2020.[99] Titan Airways received their first A321P2F in January 2021[100] which was converted at Singapore Seletar Airport, the airline has two more A321P2F\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nThe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 January 2020, to be delivered to Vallair, and it secured EASA supplementary type certificate in February.\\nIt should replace older converted Boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nAirbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] On 27 October 2020, the first A321P2F was delivered to launch operator Qantas Airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nAfter EFW began the first A320 conversion in March 2021, the A320P2F made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 December from Singapore.[104]\\nThe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be Nairobi-based Astral Aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from Middle Eastern lessor Vaayu Group.[105]\\nThe A320P2F received its supplemental type certification at the end of March 2022.[106]\\nThe A320P2F is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. The freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 LD3-type containers on the lower deck.[78]\\nThe Indian Defence Ministry greenlit the modification by the Defence Research and Development Organisation of six Air India A320s into Airborne early warning and control planes for Rs 10,500 crore (US$142 million). They are to complement the two Indian-built Netra and three Israeli-and-Russian-made Phalcons of the Indian Air Force.[107]\\nAs of August\\xa02022[update], there were 9,824 A320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. The five largest operators were American Airlines, operating 459, China Eastern Airlines with 358, EasyJet 327, China Southern Airlines 309 and IndiGo 260. Aircraft in operation include 58 A318, 1,361 A319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 A320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 A321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. All 2,374 delivered A320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 A320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 A318s, 132 A319s, 449 A320s and 47 A321s were out of service through retirement or write-off.[4]\\nAir France, British Airways, and Frontier Airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the A320ceo family.[4] Middle East Airlines received two milestone aircraft. The first was an A320ceo with manufacturer serial number (MSN) 5,000 on 20 January 2012.[108] Eight years later, on 9 October 2020, the airline received MSN 10,000, an A321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary.[109][110]\\nThe A320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007.[111] Its successor, the A320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011.[112]\\nIn November 2013, the A320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders.[113]\\nIn October 2019, the A320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the Boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136.[114]\\nIn August 2021, the A320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark,[115] 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the Boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in March 2018.[116]\\nOn 16 December 2021, the last member of the A320ceo family, an A321ceo (MSN 10315), was delivered from the assembly line Airbus Mobile in Alabama.[3]\\nIn July 2022, total orders for the A320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the A320ceo family of 8,120.\\nAs of September\\xa02022[update], a total of 10,516 A320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 A320ceos (2 A319s, 11 A320s and 7 A321s) remaining in the backlog. In the first nine months of 2022, Airbus delivered 340 A320 family aircraft, comprising A320neo variants only. The A320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with A321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631,[4][78] whereas cancellations incurred during the Boeing 737 MAX groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered.[81]\\nData as of 30\\xa0September\\xa02022[update].[4][83]\\nAcross the entire A320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred,[117] including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 on 22 May 2020),[118] for a total of 1393 fatalities.[119] The A320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost.[120]\\nAs of 2015, the Airbus A320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs.[121]\\nRelated development\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n\\nRelated lists\\n\\n\\nAn airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nThe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nIn colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nThat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nAn international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nSmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nIn the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nThe longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). The world\\'s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nAs of 2009[update], the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nMost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany\\'s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India\\'s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia[citation needed].\\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport[citation needed].\\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nMany US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA[11] under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.\\nDespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nThe Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States.[13] Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA\\'s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.[14] The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nAirports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nAirports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\nA terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. There also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nThe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"Floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nMany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.\\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.\\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nAir traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\\nThe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized ATC stations.\\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nAt all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.\\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nLarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nMany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.\\nPlanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nMost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\nAviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nMany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nAirports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\nAircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\nA growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nThe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi,[38] India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.\\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force\\'s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.\\nAn aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\\nMost airports in the United States are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nAirports are uniquely represented by their IATA airport code and ICAO airport code.\\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).\\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).\\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nThe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris, France was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nBeijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2022.[41]\\nHamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.\\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920.[43] In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nAfter World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Speed, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone (1990), Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers. They have also played important parts in television series like Lost, The Amazing Race, America\\'s Next Top Model (season 10), 90 Day Fiancé, Air Crash Investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. Good Will Hunting.\\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the Airport Tycoon series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.\\nEach civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. This will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby NAVAIDs and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary.\\nInfraero is responsible for the airports in Brazil\\nA comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group Airports Council International.\\nLists:\\nAffiliates\\nAvianca S.A. (acronym in Spanish for Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A., \"Airways of the American Continent\") is a Colombian airline. It has been the flag carrier of Colombia[3][4] since December 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name SCADTA.[5][6] It is headquartered in Colombia, with its registered office in Barranquilla and its global headquarters in Bogotá and main hub at El Dorado International Airport. Avianca is the flagship of a group of ten Latin American airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. Avianca is the largest airline in Colombia and second largest in Latin America, after LATAM of Chile. Avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in Latin America.[7] Prior to the merger with TACA in 2010, it was wholly owned by Synergy Group, a South American holding company established by Germán Efromovich and specialising in air transport. It is listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.[8]\\nThrough SCADTA, Avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after KLM, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2019. It is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere.[9] It became an official member of Star Alliance on June 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement[10] of its invitation to join the alliance.[11] On May 10, 2020, Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in New York City, and liquidated its subsidiary Avianca Perú, due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.[12][13][14]\\nThe airline traces its history back to December 5, 1919, in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the airline), Rafael María Palacio, Cristóbal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and Germans Werner Kämmerer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes Aéreos or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight on \\tSeptember 5, 1920 between Barranquilla and the nearby town of Puerto Colombia using a Junkers F.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850\\xa0km (528\\xa0mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the Junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on October 20, 1920, following the course of the Magdalena River; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and philanthropist Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the Colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in Venezuela and the United States. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned Pan Am.\\nOn June 14, 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline SACO, forming the new Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia S.A. or Avianca. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael María Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as German citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Martín del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA\\'s history as its own.\\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to Quito, Lima, Panama City, Miami, New York City and Europe, using Douglas DC-4s and C-54 Skymasters. In 1951, Avianca acquired Lockheed Constellations and Super Constellations. In 1956, the company transported the Colombian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. \\nDuring the 1960s, the company built the Avianca Building in Bogotá, designed by the architect Germán Samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of Santander Park. In 1961, Avianca leased two Boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on November 2, 1961, it acquired its own Boeing 720s. In 1976, Avianca became the first Latin American airline to continuously operate the Boeing 747-100. Three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two Combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.\\nIn 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the Terminal Puente Aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala. Avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York.[15]\\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier SAM and the helicopter operator Helicol merged, beginning Avianca\\'s new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of Boeing 767s, Boeing 757s, MD-83s, Fokker 50s, and Bell helicopters. In 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\\nOn December 10, 1998, Avianca officially opened its new hub in Bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of Colombian and international travelers between South America, Europe and North America.\\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Avianca, SAM, and their major rival ACES joined efforts to create the Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on May 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. However, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. In November 2003, the Alianza Summa was disbanded, ACES was liquidated altogether and SAM was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca\\'s brand.\\nOn December 10, 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the Brazilian consortium, Synergy Group and the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and VIP. The company\\'s full legal name was changed from Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia (National Airways of Colombia) to Aerovías del Continente Americano (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. On February 28, 2005, Avianca presented its new logo and livery.\\nIn October 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with TACA Airlines.[16][17] This created AviancaTaca Holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\\nIn November 2009, the airline\\'s Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.[18] On January 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318s leased from GECAS. The aircraft were delivered from February to April 2011.\\nOn November 10, 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca (and its merger counterpart, TACA) were full members in 2012. Due to Avianca\\'s entry into Star Alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines and began a new codeshare agreement with United Airlines. TACA had been codesharing with United Airlines since 2006.[19] On June 21, 2012, Avianca and TACA were both officially admitted into Star Alliance.\\nOn March 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from AviancaTaca Holding to Avianca Holdings.[20] TACA and all other AviancaTaca airlines changed their brand to Avianca on May 28, 2013.\\nAs of 2017, Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.\\nIn August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. This resulted in the cancellation of several flights within Colombia. Likewise, due to the stoppage of ACDAC pilots in 2017, only in October 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.\\nOn March 1, 2019, Avianca launched a subsidiary named Avianca Express, which operates ATR-72s on short regional flights within Colombia.[21]\\nAvianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. Because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on December 31, 2019. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended Avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late March and May outside of repatriation missions. As a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed.\\nAvianca Holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. The airline holding liquidated their subsidiary Avianca Perú the same day. The debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-11133. The airline had accumulated a total debt of USD $7.3 billion at the end of 2019.[22]\\nAvianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their Airbus A320s, simplifying their fleet to only the A320 family and Boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.[23][24]\\nIn November 2021, Avianca Holdings announced they would move their legal address from Panama to the United Kingdom, and that they would change their name to Avianca Group.[25] Their global headquarters remains in Bogotá. On November 2, 2021, Avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court,[26] and on December 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, Avianca emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.[27]\\nOn April 29, 2022, Avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor Viva Air Colombia and its subsidiary Viva Air Perú.[28][29]\\nOn May 11, 2022, it was announced that Avianca would merge with Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes to form the Abra Group, and that Avianca will be the acquiring company.[30][31]\\nAvianca\\'s headquarters are on Avenida El Dorado and between Carrera 60 and Gobernación de Cundinamarca, located in the Ciudad Salitre area of Bogotá. The building is located next to the Gran Estación.[32] Its previous head office was at Avenida El Dorado No. 93-30.[33]\\nAvianca\\'s hubs are in Bogotá, San Salvador, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín. Its focus cities are Barranquilla, San José, and Miami, in the latter of which Avianca is the largest foreign carrier by number of passengers.\\nAvianca has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[34]\\nAvianca has an interline agreement with Boliviana de Aviación.[35]\\nThe frequent-flyer program of Avianca and its subsidiaries is LifeMiles. This program is designed to reward customer loyalty for the Airline, Travel, and Retail sectors. LifeMiles members can earn miles every time they fly with Avianca, Star Alliance member airlines, GOL Airlines, Aeromexico, and Iberia. \\nThe program was launched in 2011, as the merger of Avianca and TACA, replacing its former program AviancaPlus. LifeMiles has been awarded 14 Freddie Awards for it\\'s outstanding performance and best promotions in the Americas during the last 9 years.\\nLifeMiles has four Elite Tiers:\\nAs of October\\xa02022[update], the Avianca fleet consists of the following aircraft:[1][36]\\nAvianca\\'s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner was delivered on December 17, 2014, and launched its first service on January 16, 2015, between Bogotá and New York City.[39][40]\\nOver the years, Avianca had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:[41][42][43]\\nThe airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. The deadliest of those incidents was Avianca Flight 011, which crashed in 1983.\\nIn its recent history, the company has won different awards:[62]\\n Media related to Avianca at Wikimedia Commons\\nFlight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight).  This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.\\nMany things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.\\nThe engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.\\nHumans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in air.\\nAn aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. An aerostat\\'s main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas[1][2] to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached.\\nAerostats are so named because they use \"aerostatic\" lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass.\\nSome things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. This is termed gliding. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. This is termed soaring. However most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. This is termed powered flight.\\nThe only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals.[3] Each of these groups\\' wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight.[4] The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods.[3]\\nBats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see bat flight).[5] However, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. Flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. \"Flying\" snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.\\nFlying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.[6]\\nMost birds fly (see bird flight), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the Phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of South America in the Cenozoic era.  The non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.[citation needed] Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.\\nAmong living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 meters (11 feet); the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at 21 kilograms (46 pounds).[7]\\nMost species of insects can fly as adults. Insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips.[8][9]\\nMechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. These machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. Gliders are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.\\nSupersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground,[10] and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.\\nHypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle and Soyuz.\\nSome things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ballistic flight. Examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc.\\nEssentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc.\\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.[11] Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\nIn 2018, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an \"ionic wind\" also known as electroaerodynamic thrust.[12][13]\\nMany human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears,[14][15] the\\nboomerang in Australia, the hot air Kongming lantern, and kites.\\nGeorge Cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century,[16][17][18] and in the second half of the 19th century Otto Lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. His work was replicated and extended by the Wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.[19]\\nSpaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard. The first orbital spaceflight was in 1957,[20] and Yuri Gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961.[21]\\nThere are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. A heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding.\\nSome vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example rockets and Harrier Jump Jets.\\nFinally, momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.\\nForces relevant to flight are[22]\\nThese forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.\\nA fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine.[23]  The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.\\nIn the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction.[24] Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with Newton\\'s third law of motion.\\nLift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word \"lift\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\\nFor a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement.[25][26][27][28] Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.\\nAerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\\nHowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced \"L over D ratio.\" An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD.[29]\\nThe lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\\n[30]\\nThe drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] \\n[31]\\nLift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.\\nLift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.[32]\\nAir pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - Archimedes\\' principle holds for air just as it does for water.\\nA cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\\nThrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the Earth\\'s standard acceleration \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ng\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle g_{0}}\\n\\n).[33] It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft).\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in gs), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.\\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible.\\nFlight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle\\'s center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (See Tait-Bryan rotations for an explanation).\\nThe control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. \"a tail\"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive dihedral angle\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\\nTo create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.\\nPropulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.[34][35]\\nThe range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.[36]\\nFor powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used.\\nAll animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.\\nVehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\\nNavigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, GPS, LORAN, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter).\\nIn aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground.\\nThe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (VFR) or the instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\\nA guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\\nA conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft\\'s direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\\nIn the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems.\\nCollision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\\nAir safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\\n Flight travel guide from Wikivoyage\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the largest transportation agency of the U.S. government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country as well as over surrounding international waters.[3]:\\u200a12,\\u200a16\\u200a Its powers include air traffic management, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of U.S. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\\nCreated in August\\xa01958\\xa0(1958-08), the FAA replaced the former Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and later became an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation.\\nThe FAA\\'s roles include:\\nThe FAA operates five \"lines of business\".[4] Their functions are:\\nThe FAA is headquartered in Washington, D.C.[10] and also operates the William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for support and research, and the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for training. The FAA has nine regional administrative offices:\\nThe Air Commerce Act of May 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the federal government\\'s regulation of civil aviation. This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\\nIn fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation\\'s system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications—before the founding of the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today—and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\\nThe Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\\nIn 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also expanded the government\\'s role by giving the CAA the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.\\nOn the eve of America\\'s entry into World War II, CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation\\'s civil airports.\\nThe approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions—most notably the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation passed the CAA\\'s functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act also transferred air safety regulation from the CAB to the FAA, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA\\'s first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former Air Force general and adviser to President Eisenhower.\\nThe same year witnessed the birth of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which was created in response to the Soviet Union (USSR) launch of the first manmade satellite.  NASA assumed NACA\\'s aeronautical research role.\\nIn 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency\\'s name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT. The FAA administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.\\nAt the same time, a new National Transportation Safety Board took over the Civil Aeronautics Board\\'s (CAB) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. CAB was merged into DOT with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.\\nThe FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security. The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. During the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.\\nBy the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 phased out the CAB\\'s economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In 1994, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.[11]\\nIn 1979, Congress authorized the FAA to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. Throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.\\nIn the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the FAA\\'s development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. In 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within DOT headquarters. The agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the September 11 attacks.\\nIn December 2000, an organization within the FAA called the Air Traffic Organization,[12] (ATO) was set up by presidential executive order. This became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the United States and for the New York (Atlantic) and Oakland (Pacific) oceanic areas. It is a full member of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation.\\nThe FAA issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. Among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the AMT Awards), a flight instructor (Gold Seal certification), a 50-year aviator (Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award), a 50-year mechanic (Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award) or as a proficient pilot. The latter, the FAA \"WINGS Program\", provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (Basic, Advanced, and Master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last WINGS award, or \"Phase\". For more information on all these programs, visit www.faasafety.gov or inquire at an FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  For more information on the WINGS program, please see FAA Advisory Circular AC 61-91J.\\nThe FAA encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety.  The FAA Safety Team, or FAASTeam, works with Volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide.  For more information, inquire at an FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).\\nOn March 18, 2008, the FAA ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that Southwest Airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections.[13] The FAA exercises surprise Red Team drills on national airports annually.\\nOn October 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism [14] from Nick Bilton of The New York Times,[15][16] the FAA announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). Implementation initially varied among airlines. The FAA expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. From a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft\\'s high speed. However, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.[17]\\nIn July 2014, in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the FAA suspended flights by U.S. airlines to Ben Gurion Airport during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict for 24 hours. The ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later.[18]\\nThe FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 gives the FAA one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers.[19][20][21]\\nThe first FAA licensed orbital human space flight took place on November 15, 2020, carried out by SpaceX on behalf of NASA.[22][23]\\nThe administrator is appointed for a five-year term.\\nOn March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Stephen Dickson, a former executive and pilot at Delta Air Lines, to be the next FAA Administrator.[30][26][27] On July 24, 2019, the Senate confirmed Dickson by a vote of 52–40.[31][32] He was sworn in as Administrator by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on August 12, 2019.[32] On February 16, 2022, Dickson announced his resignation as FAA Administrator, effective March 31, 2022.[33]\\nThe FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\"[34] Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz, who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security, is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA. Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: \"Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At $25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\"[35] Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.\\nOn July 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the Southwest Airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the House to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year \"cooling off\" period that FAA inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated.[36][37] The bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word \"customer\" properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the FAA.[36] The bill died in a Senate committee that year.[38]\\nIn September 2009, the FAA administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term \"customers\" to refer to only the flying public.[39]\\nIn 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe \"Bobby\" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline.[40] This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations.[36] The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules.[40] Oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the FAA\\'s culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption\".[40] In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks,[35] and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.[41]\\nIn 2014, the FAA modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. It launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or VRA bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands have been picked up, including veterans, CTI grads, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires. The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program. Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an FAA Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.\\nIn the process of promoting diversity, the FAA revised its hiring process.[42][43] The FAA later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. However, the \"Bio-Q\" was not the determinating factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised Air Traffic Standardized Aptitude Test (ATSAT). Due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised ATSAT, which has since been validated. In 2015 Fox News levied unsubstantiated criticism that the FAA discriminated against qualified candidates.[44]\\nIn December 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the FAA seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under FAA rules before they were abruptly changed. The prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the FAA is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the CTI program.[45]\\nA May 2017 letter from staff of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including NextGen. The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the National Research Council noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).[46][47]\\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.[48][49] A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. The result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. Complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit.[50]\\nAs a result of the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but the FAA declined to ground MAX 8 aircraft operating in the U.S.[51] On March 12, the FAA said that its ongoing review showed \"no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\"[52] Some U.S. Senators called for the FAA to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete.[52] U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that \"If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.\"[53] The FAA resisted grounding the aircraft until March 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. By then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane,[54] and by March 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. Three major U.S. airlines--Southwest, United, and American Airlines—were affected by this decision.[55]\\nFurther investigations also revealed that the FAA and Boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the FAA had retaliated against whistleblowers.[56]\\nA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 CFR section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (IC).[57] The DER system enables the FAA to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the FAA.[58] Qualifications and policies for appointment of Designated Airworthiness Representatives are established in FAA Order 8100.8, Designee Management Handbook. Working procedures for DERs are prescribed in FAA Order 8110.37, Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Handbook.\\nNeither type of DER is an employee of either the FAA or the United States government. While a DER represents the FAA when acting under the authority of a DER appointment; a DER has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a DER. Neither does the FAA provide any indemnification for a DER from general tort law. \"The FAA cannot shelter or protect DERs from the consequences of their findings.\"[59]\\nA DAR[60] is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 CFR 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. There are two types of DARs: manufacturing, and maintenance.\\nSpecialized Experience\\xa0– Amateur-Built and Light-Sport Aircraft DARs Both Manufacturing DARs and Maintenance DARs may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. DAR qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in Order 8100.8.\\nA Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (commonly abbreviated as CANIC) is a notification from the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions.[61]\\n\\nThe FAA Airworthiness Directives Manual,[62] states the following:8. Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC).\\nThe FAA issued a CANIC to state the continued airworthiness of the Boeing 737 MAX, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.[63][64][65][66]\\n\\nAnother CANIC notified the ungrounding of the MAX, ending a 20-month grounding.[67]U.S. law requires that the FAA\\'s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. On July 18, 2016, President Obama signed a second short-term extension of the FAA authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day.[68]\\nThe 2016 extension (set to expire itself in September 2017) left out a provision pushed by Republican House leadership, including House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA). The provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the FAA to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, have done.[69] Shuster\\'s bill, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act,[70] expired in the House at the end of the 114th Congress.[71]\\nThe House T&I Committee began the new reauthorization process for the FAA in February 2017. It is expected that the committee will again urge Congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. Shuster has additional support from President Trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the U.S. air control system is \"....totally out of whack.\"[72]\\n'"

              "'\\nthe airbus a320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by airbus.\\nthe a320 was launched in march 1984, first flew on 22 february 1987, and was introduced in april 1988 by air france.\\nthe first member of the family was followed by the longer a321 (first delivered in january 1994), the shorter a319 (april 1996), and the even shorter a318 (july 2003).\\nfinal assembly takes place in toulouse in france; hamburg in germany; tianjin in china since 2009; and in mobile, alabama in the united states since april 2016.\\nthe twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either cfm56 or iae v2500 turbofans, except the cfm56/pw6000 powered a318.\\nthe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\\nvariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5\\xa0t (150,000 to 206,000\\xa0lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940\\xa0km (3,100–3,750\\xa0nmi) range.\\nthe 31.4\\xa0m (103\\xa0ft) long a318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\\nthe 124-156 seat a319 is 33.8\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft) long.\\nthe a320 is 37.6\\xa0m (123\\xa0ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\\nthe 44.5\\xa0m (146\\xa0ft) a321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\\nthe airbus corporate jets are business jet versions.\\nin december 2010, airbus announced the re-engined a320neo (new engine option), which entered service with lufthansa in january 2016.\\nwith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\\nearlier a320s are now called a320ceo (current engine option).\\namerican airlines is the largest a320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] in october 2019, the a320 family surpassed the boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. \\nas of august\\xa02022[update], a total of 16,622 a320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. the global a320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.\\nthe a320ceo initially competed with the 737 classic and the md-80, then their successors, the 737 next generation and the md-90, while the 737 max is boeing\\'s response to the a320neo.\\nwhen airbus designed the a300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against boeing and douglas (later mcdonnell douglas), two established us aerospace manufacturers. from the moment of formation, airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the airbus a300b in support of this long-term goal.[5] prior to the service introduction of the first airbus airliners, engineers within airbus had identified nine possible variations of the a300 known as a300b1 to b9.[6] a 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the a300b10.[7] it was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range airbus a310. airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and mcdonnell douglas dc-9.\\nplans from a number of european aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful bac one-eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and dc-9.[8] germany\\'s mbb (messerschmitt-bölkow-blohm), british aircraft corporation, sweden\\'s saab and spain\\'s casa worked on the europlane, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[8][9] it was abandoned after intruding on a310 specifications.[9] vfw-fokker, dornier and hawker siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[8]\\nthe design within the jet study that was carried forward was the jet2 (163 passengers), which then became the airbus s.a1/2/3 series (single aisle), before settling on the a320 name for its launch in 1984. previously, hawker siddeley had produced a design called the hs.134 \"airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the hs.121 (formerly dh.121) trident,[10] which shared much of the general arrangement of the later jet3 study design. the name \"airbus\" at the time referred to a bea requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\\nin june 1977 a new joint european transport (jet) programme was set up, established by british aerospace (bae), aerospatiale, dornier and fokker.[11][12] it was based at the then bae (formerly vickers) site in weybridge, surrey, uk. although the members were all of airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from airbus.[13] this project was considered the forerunner of airbus a320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two cfm56s.[8] it would have a cruise speed of mach 0.84 (faster than the boeing 737).[8] the programme was later transferred to airbus, leading up to the creation of the single-aisle (sa) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the jet programme, derek brown.[9] the group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called sa1, sa2 and sa3.[8] although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the a319, a320 and a321, respectively.[9] the single-aisle programme created divisions within airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the west germans, particularly lufthansa.[8][13] however, works proceeded, and the german carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\\nin february 1981 the project was re-designated a320,[9] with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated sa2. during the year, airbus worked with delta air lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. the a320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440\\xa0km (2,850 or 1,860\\xa0nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.[9] the -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430\\xa0l (3,429 to 5,154\\xa0imp\\xa0gal).[14] they would measure 36.04 and 39.24\\xa0m (118\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in and 128\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), respectively.[9] airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) internal width, compared to boeing\\'s 3.45\\xa0m (11\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in).[8] although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. the a320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91\\xa0m (111\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[14]\\nthe uk, france and west germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". the germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the british wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. in the end, british work-share was increased from that of the two previous airbuses.[13]\\nfrance was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the germans were more cautious.[13] the uk government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by bae and estimated at £250\\xa0million; it was postponed for three years.[14] on 1 march 1984, the british government and bae agreed that £50\\xa0million would be paid, whether the a320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.[13]\\nin 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by flight international,[15] equivalent to £7 billion today.\\nthe programme was launched on 2 march 1984.[16] at the time, airbus had 96 orders.[17]:\\u200a48\\u200a air france was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 a320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 paris air show.[18] in october 1983, british caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80.[19] cyprus airways became the first customer to place an order for v2500-powered a320s in november 1984, followed by pan am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in january 1985, and then inex adria.[17]:\\u200a49\\u200a one of the most significant orders occurred when northwest airlines placed an order for 100 a320s in october 1986, powered by cfm56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 farnborough airshow.[17]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nduring a320 development, airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by lufthansa.[13] at the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, airbus stuck with turbofans.\\npower on the a320 was to be supplied by two cfm56-5-a1s rated at 25,000\\xa0lbf (111.2\\xa0kn).[14] it was the only engine available until the arrival of the iae v2500, offered by international aero engines, a group composed of rolls-royce plc, pratt & whitney, japanese aero engine corporation, fiat and mtu. the first v2500 variant, the v2500-a1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110\\xa0kn),[20] hence the name. it is 4% more efficient than the cfm56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -a5 at 0.574 and 0.596\\xa0lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9\\xa0g/kn/s) for the cfm56-5a1.[21]\\nin the presence of then-french prime minister jacques chirac and the prince and princess of wales, the first a320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at toulouse on 14 february 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 february in 3 hours and 23 minutes.[22] the flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. european joint aviation authorities (jaa) certification was awarded on 26 february 1988.[17]:\\u200a50\\u200a the first a320 was delivered to air france on 28 march,[23] and began commercial service on 8 april with a flight between paris and berlin via düsseldorf.[24] in 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion french francs.[25]\\nthe first derivative of the a320 was the airbus a321, also known as the stretched a320, a320-500 and a325.[9][26] its launch came on 24 november 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[9][27] the aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. the wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[9] increasing wing area from 124\\xa0m2 (1,330\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] the fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the a321 6.94 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) longer than the a320 overall.[9][29][30] the length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[14] the centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb), for a total of 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9]\\nfinal assembly for the a321 would be, as a first for any airbus, carried out in germany (then west germany).[31] this came after a dispute between the french, who claimed the move would incur $150\\xa0million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant,[9] and the germans, who argued that it would be more productive for airbus in the long run. the second production line was located at hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller airbus a319 and a318. for the first time, airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480\\xa0million (€475 million) to finance development costs.[27] an additional $180\\xa0million (€175 million) was borrowed from the european investment bank and private investors.[9]\\nthe maiden flight of the airbus a321 came on 11 march 1993, when the prototype, registration f-wwia, flew with iae v2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with cfm56-5b turbofans, flew in may. lufthansa and alitalia were the first to order the stretched airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. the first of lufthansa\\'s v2500-a5-powered a321s arrived on 27 january 1994, while alitalia received its first cfm56-5b-powered aircraft on 22 march.\\nthe a319 was the following derivative of the baseline a320. the design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat sa1, part of the single-aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings.[9] after healthy sales of the a320/a321, airbus focused once more on what was then known as the a320m-7, meaning a320 minus seven fuselage frames.[14] it would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.[9] the shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in).[29][32][33] consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. the bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height ld3-45 containers.[32] minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. power is provided by the cfm56-5a, cfm56-5b, or v2500-a5, derated to 98\\xa0kn (22,000\\xa0lbf), with option for 105\\xa0kn (24,000\\xa0lbf) thrust.[34]\\nairbus began offering the new model from 22 may 1992, with the actual launch of the $275\\xa0million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 june 1993;[32][9][6] the a319\\'s first customer was ilfc, which signed for six aircraft. on 23 march 1995, the first a319 underwent final assembly at airbus\\' german plant in hamburg, where a321s were also assembled. it was rolled out on 24 august 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day.[14] the certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. certification for the cfm56-5b6/2-equipped variant was granted in april 1996, and qualification for the v2524-a5 started the following month.[9]\\ndelivery of the first a319, to swissair, occurred on 25 april 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end.[9] in january 1997, an a319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645\\xa0km) great circle route to winnipeg, manitoba from hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes.[9] the a319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as easyjet, which purchased 172 of them.[4]\\nthe a318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between aviation industry corporation of china (avic), singapore technologies aerospace, alenia and airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. the programme was called the ae31x, and covered the 95-seat ae316 and 115- to 125-seat ae317.[9] the former would have had an overall length of 31.3\\xa0m (102\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in), while the ae317 was longer by 3.2\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), at 34.5\\xa0m (113\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in).[35] the engines were to be supplied from two rolls-royce br715s, cfm56-9s, or the pratt & whitney pw6000;[9][35] with the mtow of 53.3\\xa0t (118,000\\xa0lb) for the smaller version and 58\\xa0t (128,000\\xa0lb) for the ae317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6\\xa0kn (17,500–19,000\\xa0lbf) and 84.6–91.2\\xa0kn (19,000–20,500\\xa0lbf), respectively.[35] range was settled at 5,200\\xa0km (2,800\\xa0nmi) and 5,800\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[35] both share a wingspan of 31.0\\xa0m (101\\xa0ft 8\\xa0in)[35] and a flight deck similar to that of the a320 family. costing $2\\xa0billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in china.[9]\\nsimultaneously, airbus was developing the airbus a318. in early 1998, airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the a320. the ae31x project was terminated by september 1998, and airbus officially announced the a318[9] at that year\\'s farnborough airshow.[6] the aircraft was the smallest in airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the airbus a380. first called a319m5 in as early as march 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) behind.[6] these cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the a319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[36] range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100\\xa0nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210\\xa0nmi) with upcoming sharklets.[36]\\nthe 107-seater was launched on 26 april 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft.[6] after three years of design, the maiden flight took place at hamburg on 15 january 2002.[37] tests on the lead engine, the pw6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption.[38] consequently, pratt & whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (hpc) for the mtu-designed six-stage hpc. the 129 order book for the a318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other a320 family members.[38] after 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, jaa certification was obtained for the cfm56-powered variant on 23 may 2003.[38] on 22 july 2003, first delivery for launch customer frontier airlines occurred,[6] entering service before the end of the month.\\nthe toulouse blagnac final assembly line builds a320s, whereas the hamburg finkenwerder final assembly line builds a318s, a319s, and a321s. the airbus factory in tianjin, china assembles a319s, a320s, and a321s; a320s and a321s are also assembled at the airbus americas factory in mobile, alabama.[39] airbus produced a total of 42 a320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.[40]\\nas airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing a320neos in 2017; 147 airbus were delivered in 2016 in china, 20% of its production, mostly a320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the us before 2027.[41]\\nin june 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, airbus inaugurated its fourth hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following design thinking principles.[42] by january 2019, mobile was outputting 4.5 a320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year.[43]\\nin september 2019, airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th a320-family aircraft to easyjet. in october 2019, airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for a320 family aircraft in hamburg, showcasing an evolution in airbus\\' industrial production system.[44] production rates continue to rise, and airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year.[45]\\ndue to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 a320s.[46]\\nin october 2020, the 500th a320 built in tianjin, an a320neo, was delivered to china southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008.[47]\\nin 2006, airbus started the a320 enhanced (a320e) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.[48]\\nengine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the a320 in 2007 with the cfm56 tech insertion[49] and in 2008 with the v2500select (one).[50]\\nin 2006, airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. the first design type to be tested was developed by airbus and based on work done by the awiator programme.[51] the second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by winglet technology, a company based in wichita, kansas, usa. two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign\\xa0– the prototype a320, which had been retained by airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to jetblue.[citation needed]\\ndespite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits.[52] on 17 december 2008, airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by aviation partners inc. as part of an a320 modernisation programme using the a320 prototype.[53]\\nairbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the november 2009 dubai airshow: installation adds 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800\\xa0km (1,500\\xa0nmi),[54] saving approximately us$220,000 and 700 t of co2 per aircraft per year.[55] the 2.5 metres (8\\xa0ft 2\\xa0in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by korean air aerospace division.[56]\\nin december 2011, airbus filed suit in the western district of texas over aviation partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to aviation partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the airbus a320neo.[57]\\nthe first sharklet-equipped airbus a320 was delivered to indonesia airasia on 21 december 2012, offering a 450\\xa0kg (990\\xa0lb) payload and 190\\xa0km (100\\xa0nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications.[58]\\nin 2007, airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling.[59] it offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as leds for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (psu).[60]\\noffering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer psu, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted.[61] the flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.[62]\\nthe a320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 december 2010, making its first flight on 25 september 2014 and introduced by lufthansa on 25 january 2016. re-engined with cfm international leap-1a or pratt & whitney pw1000g engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. its three variants are based on the previous a319, a320 and a321. airbus received 6,031 orders by march 2018 and delivered 318 by may 2018. the original family was renamed a320ceo, for current engine option.\\nin 2006, airbus was studying a future replacement for the a320 series, tentatively dubbed nsr, for \"new short-range aircraft\".[63] the follow-on aircraft to replace the a320 was named a30x. airbus north america president barry eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017.[64] in january 2010, john leahy, airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025.[65]\\nthe airbus a320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\\nafter the oil price rises of the 1970s, airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the a320. to that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (efis) and a two-crew flight deck.\\nairbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the v2500-powered a320.[66]\\na 150-seat a320 burns 11,608\\xa0kg (25,591\\xa0lb) of jet fuel over 3,984\\xa0km (2,151\\xa0nmi) (between los angeles and new york city), or 2.43\\xa0l/100\\xa0km (97\\xa0mpg‑us) per seat with a 0.8\\xa0kg/l fuel.[67]\\nits wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and md-80.\\nthe airbus a320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. its wing sweep is 25 degrees. compared to other airliners of the same class, the a320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156\\xa0in) outside diameter,[29] compared to the 3.8\\xa0m (148\\xa0in) of the boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers.\\nthe a320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs.[68] its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by casa, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.[9]\\nthe a320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. it is also equipped with an electronic flight instrument system (efis) with side-stick controllers. the a320 has an electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ecam) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. the only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator.\\nsince 2003, the a320 has featured liquid crystal display (lcd) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (crt) displays. these include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display.[69]\\nairbus offers an avionics upgrade for older a320 aircraft, the in-service enhancement package, to keep them updated.[70] digital head-up displays are available.[71]\\nthe a320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the a310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by bernard ziegler, first airbus ceo henri ziegler\\'s son.[72]\\nthe a320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (fbw) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the dassault mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the airbus team which tested fbw on an a300.[73] at its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\\nall following airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. for roger béteille, then airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\"[73]\\nearly a320s used the intel 80186 and motorola 68010.[74] in 1988, the flight management computer contained six intel 80286 cpus, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.[75]\\nthe suppliers providing turbofan engines for the a320ceo family were cfm international with the cfm56, international aero engines offering its v2500, and pratt & whitney\\'s pw6000 engines available only for the a318,[76] while for the a320neo family are cfm international leap-1a or pratt & whitney pw1000g engines.\\nthe cfm56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants.\\nthe iae v2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants.\\nthe pw6000 is available on the smallest a318.\\nthe joint aviation authorities (jaa) issued the type certificate for the a320 on 26 february 1988. after entering the market on 18 april 1988 with air france, airbus then expanded the a320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat a321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat a319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat a318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.[77]\\nas of august\\xa02022[update], the global a320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service.[78]\\nthe a320 family was developed to compete with the boeing 737 classics (-300/-400/-500) and the mcdonnell douglas md-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the boeing 737 next generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. as of 2010, as well as the 737, the a320 family faces competition from embraer\\'s e-195 (to the a318), and the cseries being developed by bombardier[79] to the a318/a319.\\nairbus has delivered 8,605 a320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 december 2018).[4] in comparison, boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918[80] of those deliveries since march 1988,[81] and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 december 2018).[81]\\nby september 2018, there were 7,251 a320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737ngs, while airbus expected to deliver 3,174 a320neos compared with 2,999 boeing 737 max through 2022.\\nairbus sold the a320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but cfm engines are extremely reliable.\\nthe six-month head-start of the a320neo allowed airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before boeing announced the max.\\nthe a321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the a321neo is again dominating the 737-9 max, to be joined by the 737-10 max.[82]\\n\\na checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals.\\nthe baseline a320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the a318,[36] to 220, on the a321.[30] they compete with the 737, 757, and 717. because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. today all variants are available as corporate jets. an a319 variant known as a319lr is also developed. military versions like a319 mpa also exists. american airlines is the largest airline operator of the a320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 september 2017.[4]\\ntechnically, the name \"a320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the a318/a319/a320/a321 family. all variants are able to be etops (extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (easa) and 2006 (faa).[85] with launch of the new airbus a320neo project, the previous members of the airbus a320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"ceo\" name.\\nthe airbus a318 is the smallest member of the airbus a320 family. the a318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700\\xa0km (3,100\\xa0nmi). the aircraft entered service in july 2003 with frontier airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other airbus a320 family variants, allowing existing a320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. it is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the european aviation safety agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as london city airport. relative to other airbus a320 family variants, the a318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31\\xa0october\\xa02015[update].\\nin 2018, the a318 list price was us$77.4 million.[86]\\nthe a319 is 3.73\\xa0m (12\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) shorter than the a320.[29][32][33]\\nalso known as the a320m-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the a320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. with a similar fuel capacity as the a320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650\\xa0km (3,590\\xa0nmi), or 6,850\\xa0km (3,700\\xa0nmi) with the \"sharklets\".[33] four propulsion options available on the a319 are the 23,040–24,800\\xa0lbf (102.5–110.3\\xa0kn) iae v2500, or the 22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf (98–120\\xa0kn) cfm56.[6] although identical to those of the a320, these engines are derated because of the a319\\'s lower mtow.\\nthe a319 was developed at the request of steven f. udvar-házy, the former president and ceo of ilfc.[88] the a319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ilfc, which had placed an order for six a319s by 1993.[9] anticipating further orders by swissair and alitalia, airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 june 1993. final assembly of the first a319 began on 23 march 1995[14] and it was first introduced with swissair in april 1996. the direct boeing competitor is the boeing 737-700.\\na total of 1,460 of the a319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017.[4] a 1998 a319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019.[89]\\nin 2018, the a319 list price was us$92.3 million.[86]\\nthe a319cj (rebranded the acj319) is the corporate jet version of the a319. it incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500\\xa0m (41,000\\xa0ft).[90] range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (acts) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000\\xa0nmi).[91][92] upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard a319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. it was formerly also known as the acj, or airbus corporate jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation acj319.\\nthe aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. tyrolean jet services mfg. gmbh & co kg, mjet and reliance industries are among its users. the a319cj competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the boeing 737-700-based boeing business jet (bbj) and embraer lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range gulfstream g650, gulfstream g550 and bombardier\\'s global 6000. it is powered by the same engine types as the a320. the a319cj was used by the escadron de transport, d\\'entraînement et de calibration which is in charge of transportation for france\\'s officials and also by the flugbereitschaft of the german air force for transportation of germany\\'s officials. an acj serves as a presidential or official aircraft of armenia,[93] azerbaijan, brazil, bulgaria, czech republic, germany, italy,[94] malaysia, slovakia, thailand, turkey, ukraine, and venezuela.\\nthe a320 series has two variants, the a320-100 and a320-200. only 21 a320-100s were produced.[9] these aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to air inter\\xa0–  later acquired by air france\\xa0–  and british airways as a result of an order from british caledonian made prior to its acquisition.\\nthe primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. indian airlines used its first 31 a320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.\\npowered by two cfm56-5s or iae v2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120\\xa0kn (22,000–27,000\\xa0lbf), the a320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300\\xa0nmi / 6,100\\xa0km.[29] a total of 4,512 of the a320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017.[4] the closest boeing competitor is the 737-800.[95]\\nin 1988, the value of a new a320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the a320neo.[96]\\nin 2018, its list price was us$101.0 million.[86]\\nas the a320 was beginning operations in 1988, the a321 was launched as its first derivative the same year.[9] the a321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in), with a 4.27\\xa0m (14\\xa0ft 0\\xa0in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67\\xa0m (8\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in) rear plug.[6] the a321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600\\xa0kg (21,200\\xa0lb) to 83,000\\xa0kg (183,000\\xa0lb).[9] to maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4\\xa0m2 (43\\xa0sq\\xa0ft), to 128\\xa0m2 (1,380\\xa0sq\\xa0ft).[28] the maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 march 1993.[14] the a321-100 entered service in january 1994 with lufthansa.\\nas the a321-100 range was less than the a320, development of the heavier and longer range a321-200 began in 1995. the higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (v2533-a5 or cfm56-5b3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990\\xa0l (790\\xa0us\\xa0gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold.[6] its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030\\xa0l (7,930\\xa0us\\xa0gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000\\xa0kg (205,000\\xa0lb). it first flew in december 1996 and entered service with monarch airlines in april 1997.\\nthe a321\\'s closest boeing competitors are the 737-900/900er,[95] and the 757-200.[28] a total 1,562 of the a321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017.[4] in 2018, the a321 list price was us$118.3 million.[86]\\na programme to convert a320 and a321 aircraft into freighters was set up by airbus freighter conversion gmbh. airframes would be converted by elbe flugzeugwerke gmbh (efw) in dresden, germany, and zhukovsky, russia. the launch customer aercap signed a firm contract on 16 july 2008 to convert 30 of aercap\\'s passenger a320/a321s into a320/a321p2f (passenger to freighter). however, on 3 june 2011, airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.[97]\\non 17 june 2015 st aerospace signed agreements with airbus and efw for a collaboration to launch the a320/a321 passenger-to-freighter (p2f) conversion programme.[98]\\nin august 2019, qantas was announced as the launch operator for the a321p2f converted freighter, for australia post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in october 2020.[99] titan airways received their first a321p2f in january 2021[100] which was converted at singapore seletar airport, the airline has two more a321p2f\\'s that are yet to be converted.[101]\\nthe initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 january 2020, to be delivered to vallair, and it secured easa supplementary type certificate in february.\\nit should replace older converted boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9\\xa0t (62,000\\xa0lb) over 4,300\\xa0km (2,300\\xa0nmi).\\nairbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period.[102] on 27 october 2020, the first a321p2f was delivered to launch operator qantas airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed.[103]\\nafter efw began the first a320 conversion in march 2021, the a320p2f made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 december from singapore.[104]\\nthe aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be nairobi-based astral aviation from the second

lists\\n\\n\\nan airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.[1][2]  airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land[3] or a helipad,[4] and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars[5] and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. in some countries, the us in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\\noperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.\\nthe terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and stolport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.\\nin colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. however, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. in some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.[6]\\nthat is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. in jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. in us technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".[7]\\nan airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. an airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.\\nan international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed]\\nsmaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000\\xa0m (3,300\\xa0ft). larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000\\xa0m (6,600\\xa0ft) or longer. skyline airport in inkom, idaho has a runway that is only 122\\xa0m (400\\xa0ft) long.[8]\\nin the united states, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the far landing and takeoff field lengths. these include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.\\nthe longest public-use runway in the world is at qamdo bamda airport in china. it has a length of 5,500\\xa0m (18,045\\xa0ft). the world\\'s widest paved runway is at ulyanovsk vostochny airport in russia and is 105\\xa0m (344\\xa0ft) wide.\\nas of 2009[update], the cia stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the us, the us having the most in the world.[9][10]\\nmost of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. for example, in the uk the state-owned british airports authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the spanish ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just heathrow. germany\\'s frankfurt airport is managed by the quasi-private firm fraport. while in india gmr group operates, through joint ventures, indira gandhi international airport and rajiv gandhi international airport. bengaluru international airport and chhatrapati shivaji international airport are controlled by gvk group. the rest of india\\'s airports are managed by the airports authority of india. in pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the pakistan civil aviation authority except for sialkot international airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in pakistan and south asia[citation needed].\\nin the us, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the los angeles world airports authority that oversees several airports in the greater los angeles area, including los angeles international airport[citation needed].\\nin canada, the federal authority, transport canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. now most airports in canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.\\nmany us airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. all us commercial airport runways are certified by the faa[11] under the code of federal regulations title 14 part 139, \"certification of commercial service airports\"[12] but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the faa.\\ndespite the reluctance to privatize airports in the us (contrary to the faa sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (goco) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.\\nthe airport & airway trust fund (aatf) was created by the airport and airway development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the united states.[13] airport improvement program (aip), facilities and equipment (f&e), and research, engineering, and development (re&d) are the three major accounts of federal aviation administration which are financed by the aatf, as well as pays for the faa\\'s operation and maintenance (o&m) account.[14] the funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.[15]\\nairports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.[16]\\naeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.[17] landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.[18] passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.[19] every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, john f kennedy airport in new york city charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.[20]\\nnon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. it includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.[21] concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange.[19] car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. o\\'hare international airport in chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.[22]\\nairports are divided into landside and airside zones. the landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities.[23] the airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.\\na terminal is a building with passenger facilities. small airports have one terminal. large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like amsterdam airport schiphol still have one terminal. the terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.\\nthe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\\nthe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\\nfor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. there also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\\nthe area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly,[24] \"the tarmac\").\\nairports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. however, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. international flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\\n\"floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology.\\nairport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. since the september 11 attacks and the real id act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\\nmost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. these include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the us amounted to $4.2\\xa0billion in 2015.[25] prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. however, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". this term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (msrp) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed]\\nmany new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security.[26]  airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.\\napart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.[27]\\nsome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\\nmajor airports in such countries as russia and japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. the smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in japan. a slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. an even larger type is provided by the company yotel.\\nairports may also contain premium and vip services. the premium and vip services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. these services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. this can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\\nsometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\\nairline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, wi-fi and internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\\nairlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\\nin addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\\ncargo terminal facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\\nevery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. the landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. in addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.\\nairports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\\nmany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance frankfurt airport, amsterdam airport schiphol, london heathrow airport, tokyo haneda airport, tokyo narita airport, london gatwick airport and london stansted airport. it is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. some examples of this would include the airtrain jfk at john f. kennedy international airport in new york, link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown seattle to seattle–tacoma international airport, and the silver line t at boston\\'s logan international airport by the massachusetts bay transportation authority (mbta). such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\\nthe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. it is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. some airports like hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport and london stansted airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as john f. kennedy international airport, mexico city international airport and london gatwick airport.\\nthere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\\nair traffic control (atc) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. at the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\\na \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. a \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (ctaf) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. the ctaf may be a universal integrated community (unicom), multicom, flight service station (fss), or tower frequency.\\nthe majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. not all towered airports have 24/7 atc operations. in those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. remote and virtual tower (rvt) is a system in which atc is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\\nair traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. the busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized atc stations.\\nground control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. this includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. ground control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. when a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from tower to ground control.\\ntower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3d space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. they coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\\nat all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the us) is possible. they may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. there is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. and due to the so-called slot-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. if for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. for smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ils equipment, things are very different though.\\ngenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). each leg is named (see diagram), and atc directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000\\xa0ft (244 or 305\\xa0m) above ground level (agl). standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. one of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. the predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.\\nat controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. while this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. the system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\\nthere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. a visual approach slope indicator (vasi) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. some airports are equipped with a vhf omnidirectional range (vor) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. vors are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (dme) to determine the distance to the vor. vors are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. in poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ils) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. the number of instrument approaches based on the use of the global positioning system (gps) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\\nlarger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (par), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. the aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\\nairport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\\nmany airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\\non runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or als). low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.\\nalong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\\nweather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. in the us and canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an awos, asos, or awss, a human observer or a combination of the two. these weather observations, predominantly in the metar format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (atis), via the atc or the flight service station.\\nplanes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.[28]\\nmost airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\\namong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\\nthe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\\nlike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. with many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.[29]\\nto manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: cmms (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.[29]\\naviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. the crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\\nhazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. the fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). in adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. for waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.\\nmany airports are built near open fields or wetlands. these tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\\nsome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\\nan airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. these locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the faa in the us) and airport administrators.\\nduring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as delta air lines flight 191. microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\\nsome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. these surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\\nairports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. these use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic.  at airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations.\\naircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. noise can have other health effects as well. other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.[30]\\nthe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed]\\nthe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. for example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. in addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.[31][citation needed]  airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now.[32]  a temperature rise of 2oc – consistent with the paris agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding.[32]  if global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.[32]\\nsome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. these reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\\na 2019 report from the cooperative research programs of the us transportation research board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction initiatives. small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.[33]\\na growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use.[34][35] the national renewable energy lab has shown this can be done safely.[36] this can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.[37][clarification needed]\\nthe world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at kochi,[38] india. another airport known for considering environmental concerns is seymour airport in the galapagos islands.\\nan airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. for example, raf brize norton in the uk has a terminal that caters to passengers for the royal air force\\'s scheduled flights to the falkland islands. some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same atc facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. bardufoss airport, bardufoss air station in norway and pune airport in india are examples of this.\\nan aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. after their development in world war i, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during world war ii.\\nmost airports in the united states are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).\\nairports are uniquely represented by their iata airport code and icao airport code.\\nmost airport names include the location. many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., charles de gaulle airport, george bush intercontinental airport, lennart meri airport, o.r. tambo international airport, soekarno–hatta international airport), a monarch (e.g. chhatrapati shivaji international airport, king shaka international airport), a cultural leader (e.g. liverpool john lennon airport, leonardo da vinci-fiumicino airport, louis armstrong new orleans international airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. sydney kingsford smith airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. allama iqbal international airport) and explorers (e.g. venice marco polo airport).\\nsome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed]\\nsome airport names include the word \"international\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. this includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. port elizabeth international airport).\\nthe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.[39] the plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. a slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. however, these functioned well only in dry conditions. later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\\nthe title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. toussus-le-noble airport near paris, france was established in 1907 and has been operating since. college park airport in maryland, us, established in 1909 by wilbur wright serves only general aviation traffic.\\nbeijing nanyuan airport in china, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.[40] it was in operation until september 2019. pearson field airport in vancouver, washington, united states, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of january 2022.[41]\\nhamburg airport opened in january 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. bremen airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an american military field between 1945 and 1949. amsterdam airport schiphol opened on september 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since december 17, 1920, allowing sydney airport—which started operations in january 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports.[42] minneapolis-saint paul international airport in the us opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. it serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. don mueang international airport near bangkok, thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the rome ciampino airport, which opened in 1916.\\nincreased aircraft traffic during world war i led to the construction of landing fields. aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\\nfollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. one of the earliest such fields was paris – le bourget airport at le bourget, near paris. the first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was hounslow heath aerodrome in august 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by croydon airport in march 1920.[43] in 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at flughafen devau near what was then königsberg, east prussia. the airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\\nthe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. these indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. the colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the international civil aviation organization (icao). in the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. this consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\\nafter world war ii, airport design became more sophisticated. passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. this arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. but it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\\nan improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. these run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels.\\nairport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. runways were extended out to 3,000\\xa0m (9,800\\xa0ft). the fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. the early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. these systems became commonplace in the united states by the 1970s.[citation needed]\\nthe malicious use of uavs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (c-uas) technologies such as the aaronia aartos which have been installed on major international airports.[44][45]\\nairports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. one such example of this is the terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. they are also one of the major elements in movies such as the v.i.p.s, speed, airplane!, airport (1970), die hard 2, soul plane, jackie brown, get shorty, home alone (1990), home alone 2: lost in new york (1992), liar liar, passenger 57, final

top model (season 10), 90 day fiancé, air crash investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. in other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. good will hunting.\\nseveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. these include the airport tycoon series, simairport and airport ceo.\\neach civil aviation

(acronym in spanish for aerovias del continente americano s.a., \"airways of the american continent\") is a colombian airline. it has been the flag carrier of colombia[3][4] since december 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name scadta.[5][6] it is headquartered in colombia, with its registered office in barranquilla and its global headquarters in bogotá and main hub at el dorado international airport. avianca is the flagship of a group of ten latin american airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. avianca is the largest airline in colombia and second largest in latin america, after latam of chile. avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in latin america.[7] prior to the merger with taca in 2010, it was wholly owned by synergy group, a south american holding company established by germán efromovich and specialising in air transport. it is listed on the colombia stock exchange.[8]\\nthrough scadta, avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after klm, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in december 2019. it is the oldest airline in the western hemisphere.[9] it became an official member of star alliance on june 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement[10] of its invitation to join the alliance.[11] on may 10, 2020, avianca filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in new york city, and liquidated its subsidiary avianca perú, due to the covid-19 pandemic crisis.[12][13][14]\\nthe airline traces its history back to december 5, 1919, in the city of barranquilla, colombia. colombians ernesto cortissoz alvarez-correa (the first president of the airline), rafael maría palacio, cristóbal restrepo, jacobo correa and aristides noguera and germans werner kämmerer, stuart hosie and albert tietjen founded the colombo-german company, called sociedad colombo-alemana de transportes aéreos or scadta. the company accomplished their first flight on \\tseptember 5, 1920 between barranquilla and the nearby town of puerto colombia using a junkers f.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. the flight was piloted by german helmuth von krohn. this and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. there were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850\\xa0km (528\\xa0mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. using these floats, helmuth von krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over colombia on october 20, 1920, following the course of the magdalena river; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\\nsoon after the airline was founded, german scientist and philanthropist peter von bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. this new contract allowed scadta to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. by the mid-1920s, scadta started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in venezuela and the united states. in 1924, the aircraft that both ernesto cortissoz and helmuth von krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as bocas de ceniza in barranquilla, killing them. in the early 1940s, peter von bauer sold his shares in the airline to the us-owned pan am.\\non june 14, 1940, in the city of barranquilla, scadta, under ownership by united states businessmen, merged with regional colombian airline saco, forming the new aerovías nacionales de colombia s.a. or avianca. five colombians participated in this: rafael maría palacio, jacobo a. corea, cristobal restrepo, and aristides noguera, as well as german citizens albert teitjen, werner kaemerer and stuart hosie, while the post of first president of avianca was filled by martín del corral. avianca claims scadta\\'s history as its own.\\nin 1946, avianca began flights to quito, lima, panama city, miami, new york city and europe, using douglas dc-4s and c-54 skymasters. in 1951, avianca acquired lockheed constellations and super constellations. in 1956, the company transported the colombian delegation to the melbourne olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. \\nduring the 1960s, the company built the avianca building in bogotá, designed by the architect germán samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of santander park. in 1961, avianca leased two boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on november 2, 1961, it acquired its own boeing 720s. in 1976, avianca became the first latin american airline to continuously operate the boeing 747-100. three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.\\nin 1981, avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the terminal puente aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by president julio césar turbay ayala. avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving cali, medellín, miami and new york.[15]\\nin 1994, avianca, the regional carrier sam and the helicopter operator helicol merged, beginning avianca\\'s new system of operations. this arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (avianca cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of boeing 767s, boeing 757s, md-83s, fokker 50s, and bell helicopters. in 1996, avianca postal services became deprisa, which provided various mail services.\\non december 10, 1998, avianca officially opened its new hub in bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of colombian and international travelers between south america, europe and north america.\\nafter the september 11 attacks, avianca, sam, and their major rival aces joined efforts to create the alianza summa, which began merged operations on may 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. however, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. in november 2003, the alianza summa was disbanded, aces was liquidated altogether and sam was acquired to be a regional carrier under avianca\\'s brand.\\non december 10, 2004, avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the brazilian consortium, synergy group and the national federation of coffee growers of colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for us$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\\nunder this plan, avianca was bought by synergy group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries oceanair and vip. the company\\'s full legal name was changed from aerovías nacionales de colombia (national airways of colombia) to aerovías del continente americano (airways of the american continent), retaining the acronym avianca. on february 28, 2005, avianca presented its new logo and livery.\\nin october 2009, it was announced that avianca would merge with taca airlines.[16][17] this created aviancataca holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\\nin november 2009, the airline\\'s chief executive fabio villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its fokker 50 and fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.[18] on january 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 airbus a318s leased from gecas. the aircraft were delivered from february to april 2011.\\non november 10, 2010, star alliance announced that avianca (and its merger counterpart, taca) were full members in 2012. due to avianca\\'s entry into star alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with delta air lines and began a new codeshare agreement with united airlines. taca had been codesharing with united airlines since 2006.[19] on june 21, 2012, avianca and taca were both officially admitted into star alliance.\\non march 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from aviancataca holding to avianca holdings.[20] taca and all other aviancataca airlines changed their brand to avianca on may 28, 2013.\\nas of 2017, avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from miami with 16, second only to american airlines.\\nin august 2018, avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. this resulted in the cancellation of several flights within colombia. likewise, due to the stoppage of acdac pilots in 2017, only in october 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.\\non march 1, 2019, avianca launched a subsidiary named avianca express, which operates atr-72s on short regional flights within colombia.[21]\\navianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on december 31, 2019. in response to the global outbreak of covid-19, the colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late march and may outside of repatriation missions. as a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed.\\navianca holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on may 10, 2020 as a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. the airline holding liquidated their subsidiary avianca perú the same day. the debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under case no. 20-11133. the airline had accumulated a total debt of usd $7.3 billion at the end of 2019.[22]\\navianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their airbus a320s, simplifying their fleet to only the a320 family and boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.[23][24]\\nin november 2021, avianca holdings announced they would move their legal address from panama to the united kingdom, and that they would change their name to avianca group.[25] their global headquarters remains in bogotá. on november 2, 2021, avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court,[26] and on december 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, avianca emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.[27]\\non april 29, 2022, avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor viva

operated a variety of aircraft, including:[41][42][43]\\nthe airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. the deadliest of those incidents was avianca flight 011, which crashed in 1983.\\nin its recent history, the company has won different awards:[62]\\n media related to avianca at wikimedia commons\\nflight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight).  this can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.\\nmany things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.\\nthe engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.\\nhumans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in air.\\nan aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. an aerostat\\'s main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas[1][2] to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached.\\naerostats are so named because they use \"aerostatic\" lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. by contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass.\\nsome things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. this is termed gliding. some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. this is termed soaring. however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. this is termed powered flight.\\nthe only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. the extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals.[3] each of these groups\\' wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight.[4] the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods.[3]\\nbats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see bat flight).[5] however, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. \"flying\" snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.\\nflying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. it is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. the longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.[6]\\nmost birds fly (see bird flight), with some exceptions. the largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era.  the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.[citation needed] most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.\\namong living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 meters (11 feet); the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at 21 kilograms (46 pounds).[7]\\nmost species of insects can fly as adults. insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips.[8][9]\\nmechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. these machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. gliders are capable of unpowered flight. another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. in an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. there are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.\\nsupersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground,[10] and is frequently startling. this shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.\\nhypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz.\\nsome things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. this is termed ballistic flight. examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc.\\nessentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc.\\nspaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites.\\na spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth.[11] once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\nin 2018, researchers at massachusetts institute of technology (mit) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an \"ionic wind\" also known as electroaerodynamic thrust.[12][13]\\nmany human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears,[14][15] the\\nboomerang in australia, the hot air kongming lantern, and kites.\\ngeorge cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century,[16][17][18] and in the second half of the 19th century otto lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. his work was replicated and extended by the wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.[19]\\nspaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h. goddard. the first orbital spaceflight was in 1957,[20] and yuri gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961.[21]\\nthere are different approaches to flight. if an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. a heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding.\\nsome vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example rockets and harrier jump jets.\\nfinally, momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.\\nforces relevant to flight are[22]\\nthese forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.\\na fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine.[23]  the forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring v/stol aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.\\nin the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction.[24] aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with newton\\'s third law of motion.\\nlift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). while common meanings of the word \"lift\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. when an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. on high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\\nfor a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement.[25][26][27][28] therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. the process which creates lift also causes some drag.\\naerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. for sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. in general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\\nhowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. the lift to drag ratio is the l/d ratio, pronounced \"l over d ratio.\" an airplane has a high l/d ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. the lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, cl/cd.[29]\\nthe lift coefficient cl is equal to the lift l divided by the (density r times half the velocity v squared times the wing area a). [cl = l / (a * .5 * r * v^2)] the lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity v is not a linear function. compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\\n[30]\\nthe drag coefficient cd is equal to the drag d divided by the (density r times half the velocity v squared times the reference area a). [cd = d / (a * .5 * r * v^2)] \\n[31]\\nlift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. a greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. however a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.\\nlift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. the only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.[32]\\nair pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. the buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - archimedes\\' principle holds for air just as it does for water.\\na cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. if the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. if an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\\nthrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the earth\\'s standard acceleration \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ng\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle g_{0}}\\n\\n).[33] it is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft).\\nif the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in gs), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.\\nif the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible.\\nflight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. the three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle\\'s center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (see tait-bryan rotations for an explanation).\\nthe control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. \"a tail\"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive dihedral angle\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\\nto create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.\\npropulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.[34][35]\\nthe range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.[36]\\nfor powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used.\\nall animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.\\nvehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. some aircraft such as helicopters and harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\\nnavigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, gps, loran, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter).\\nin aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground.\\nthe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (vfr) or the instrument flight rules (ifr). in the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. in the vfr case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. this may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\\na guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\\na conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft\\'s direction in flight. aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\\nin the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems.\\ncollision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\\nair safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. it can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\\n flight travel guide from wikivoyage\\n\\nthe federal aviation administration (faa) is the largest transportation agency of the u.s. government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country as well as over surrounding international waters.[3]:\\u200a12,\\u200a16\\u200a its powers include air traffic management, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of u.s. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the faa by authority of the international civil aviation organization.\\ncreated in august\\xa01958\\xa0(1958-08), the faa replaced the former civil aeronautics administration (caa) and later became an agency within the u.s. department of transportation.\\nthe faa\\'s roles include:\\nthe faa operates five \"lines of business\".[4] their functions are:\\nthe faa is headquartered in washington, d.c.[10] and also operates the william j. hughes technical center in atlantic city, new jersey, for support and research, and the mike monroney aeronautical center in oklahoma city, oklahoma, for training. the faa has nine regional administrative offices:\\nthe air commerce act of may 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the federal government\\'s regulation of civil aviation. this landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. the act charged the secretary of commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. the newly created aeronautics branch, operating under the department of commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\\nin fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the u.s. department of commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. it took over the building and operation of the nation\\'s system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the post office department. the department of commerce improved aeronautical radio communications—before the founding of the federal communications commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today—and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\\nthe aeronautics branch was renamed the bureau of air commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the department. as commercial flying increased, the bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (atc) along the airways. in 1936, the bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the atc system. the pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\\nin 1938, the civil aeronautics act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the commerce department to a new independent agency, the civil aeronautics authority. the legislation also expanded the government\\'s role by giving the caa the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\\npresident franklin d. roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the civil aeronautics administration (caa) and the civil aeronautics board (cab). caa was responsible for atc, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. cab was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. the caa was part of the department of commerce. the cab was an independent federal agency.\\non the eve of america\\'s entry into world war ii, caa began to extend its atc responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. this expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. the application of radar to atc helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. in 1946, meanwhile, congress gave caa the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation\\'s civil airports.\\nthe approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions—most notably the 1956 grand canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the federal aviation act of 1958. this legislation passed the caa\\'s functions to a new independent body, the federal aviation agency. the act also transferred air safety regulation from the cab to the faa, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. the faa\\'s first administrator, elwood r. quesada, was a former air force general and adviser to president eisenhower.\\nthe same year witnessed the birth of the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), which was created in response to the soviet union (ussr) launch of the first manmade satellite.  nasa assumed naca\\'s aeronautical research role.\\nin 1967, a new u.s. department of transportation (dot) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. the federal aviation agency\\'s name changed to the federal aviation administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., federal highway administration, federal railroad administration, the coast guard, and the saint lawrence seaway commission) within dot. the faa administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the secretary of transportation. new programs and budget requests would have to be approved by dot, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.\\nat the same time, a new national transportation safety board took over the civil aeronautics board\\'s (cab) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. cab was merged into dot with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.\\nthe faa gradually assumed additional functions. the hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. in response to the hijackings on september 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the department of homeland security. the faa became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. during the 1960s and 1970s, the faa also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.\\nby the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. this system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the airline deregulation act of 1978 phased out the cab\\'s economic regulation of the airlines. a nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. during the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. in 1994, the faa shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.[11]\\nin 1979, congress authorized the faa to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.\\nin the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the faa\\'s development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. in 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within dot headquarters. the agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the september 11 attacks.\\nin december 2000, an organization within the faa called the air traffic organization,[12] (ato) was set up by presidential executive order. this became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the united states and for the new york (atlantic) and oakland (pacific) oceanic areas. it is a full member of the civil air navigation services organisation.\\nthe faa issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the amt awards), a flight instructor (gold seal certification), a 50-year aviator (wright brothers master pilot award), a 50-year mechanic (charles taylor master mechanic award) or as a proficient pilot. the latter, the faa \"wings program\", provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (basic, advanced, and master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last wings award, or \"phase\". for more information on all these programs, visit www.faasafety.gov or inquire at an faa flight standards district office (fsdo).  for more information on the wings program, please see faa advisory circular ac 61-91j.\\nthe faa encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety.  the faa safety team, or faasteam, works with volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide.  for more information, inquire at an faa flight standards district office (fsdo).\\non march 18, 2008, the faa ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that southwest airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections.[13] the faa exercises surprise red team drills on national airports annually.\\non october 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism [14] from nick bilton of the new york times,[15][16] the faa announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). implementation initially varied among airlines. the faa expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to federal communications commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. from a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft\\'s high speed. however, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. if an air carrier provides wi-fi service during flight, passengers may use it. short-range bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.[17]\\nin july 2014, in the wake of the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17, the faa suspended flights by u.s. airlines to ben gurion airport during the 2014 israel–gaza conflict for 24 hours. the ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later.[18]\\nthe faa reauthorization act of 2018 gives the faa one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers.[19][20][21]\\nthe first faa licensed orbital human space flight took place on november 15, 2020, carried out by spacex on behalf of nasa.[22][23]\\nthe administrator is appointed for a five-year term.\\non march 19, 2019, president donald trump announced he would nominate stephen dickson, a former executive and pilot at delta air lines, to be the next faa administrator.[30][26][27] on july 24, 2019, the senate confirmed dickson by a vote of 52–40.[31][32] he was sworn in as administrator by transportation secretary elaine chao on august 12, 2019.[32] on february 16, 2022, dickson announced his resignation as faa administrator, effective march 31, 2022.[33]\\nthe faa has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\"[34] retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz, who used to be a special agent with the office of inspector general for the department of transportation and with faa security, is one of the most outspoken critics of faa. rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against southwest airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an associated press story: \"penalties against airlines that violate faa directives should be stiffer. at $25,000 per violation, gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. he also said the faa is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\"[35] other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the faa is expected to operate. the dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. for example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an faa regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.\\non july 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the southwest airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the house to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year \"cooling off\" period that faa inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated.[36][37] the bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word \"customer\" properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the faa.[36] the bill died in a senate committee that year.[38]\\nin september 2009, the faa administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term \"customers\" to refer to only the flying public.[39]\\nin 2007, two faa whistleblowers, inspectors charalambe \"bobby\" boutris and douglas e. peters, alleged that boutris said he attempted to ground southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline.[40] this was validated by a report by the department of transportation which found faa managers had allowed southwest airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations.[36] the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings in april 2008. jim oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with faa safety rules.[40] oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior faa officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the faa\\'s culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption\".[40] in 2008 the faa proposed to fine southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks,[35] and in 2009 southwest and the faa agreed that southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if southwest failed to follow through.[41]\\nin 2014, the faa modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. it launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or vra bids, something that had last been done in 2008. thousands have been picked up, including veterans, cti grads, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires. the move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a cti program. before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. however, the cti program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. the goal of the program was to prepare people for the faa academy in oklahoma city, ok. having a cti certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the air traffic basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into initial qualification training (iqt). all prospective controllers, cti or not, have had to pass the faa academy in order to be hired as a controller. failure at the academy means faa employment is terminated. in january 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an faa control tower operator certificate (cto) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. this was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the faa academy entirely.\\nin the process of promoting diversity, the faa revised its hiring process.[42][43] the faa later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. however, the \"bio-q\" was not the determinating factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised air traffic standardized aptitude test (atsat). due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised atsat, which has since been validated. in 2015 fox news levied unsubstantiated criticism that the faa discriminated against qualified candidates.[44]\\nin december 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the faa seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under faa rules before they were abruptly changed. the prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the faa is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the cti program.[45]\\na may 2017 letter from staff of the u.s. house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including nextgen. the letter said the faa initially described nextgen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. in 2015, however, the national research council noted that nextgen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the national airspace system (nas).[46][47]\\nmore precise pbn can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.[48][49] a feature of the nextgen program is gps-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. the result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit.[50]\\nas a result of the march 10, 2019 ethiopian airlines flight 302 crash and the lion air flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the boeing 737 max 8 (and in many cases all max variants) due to safety concerns, but the faa declined to ground max 8 aircraft operating in the u.s.[51] on march 12, the faa said that its ongoing review showed \"no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\"[52] some u.s. senators called for the faa to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the ethiopian airlines crash was complete.[52] u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said that \"if the faa identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.\"[53] the faa resisted grounding the aircraft until march 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. by then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane,[54] and by march 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. three major u.s. airlines--southwest, united, and american airlines—were affected by this decision.[55]\\nfurther investigations also revealed that the faa and boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the faa had retaliated against whistleblowers.[56]\\na designated engineering representative (der) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 cfr section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (ic).[57] the der system enables the faa to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the faa.[58] qualifications and policies for appointment of designated airworthiness representatives are established in faa order 8100.8, designee management handbook. working procedures for ders are prescribed in faa order 8110.37, designated engineering representative (der) handbook.\\nneither type of der is an employee of either the faa or the united states government. while a der represents the faa when acting under the authority of a der appointment; a der has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a der. neither does the faa provide any indemnification for a der from general tort law. \"the faa cannot shelter or protect ders from the consequences of their findings.\"[59]\\na dar[60] is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 cfr 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. there are two types of dars: manufacturing, and maintenance.\\nspecialized experience\\xa0– amateur-built and light-sport aircraft dars both manufacturing dars and maintenance dars may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. dar qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in order 8100.8.\\na continued airworthiness notification to the international community (commonly abbreviated as canic) is a notification from the united states federal aviation administration (faa) to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions.[61]\\n\\nthe faa airworthiness directives manual,[62] states the following:8. continued airworthiness notification to the international community (canic).\\nthe faa issued a canic to state the continued airworthiness of the boeing 737 max, following the crash of ethiopian airlines flight 302.[63][64][65][66]\\n\\nanother canic notified the ungrounding of the max, ending a 20-month grounding.[67]u.s. law requires that the faa\\'s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. on july 18, 2016, president obama signed a second short-term extension of the faa authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day.[68]\\nthe 2016 extension (set to expire itself in september 2017) left out a provision pushed by republican house leadership, including house transportation and infrastructure (t&i) committee chairman bill shuster (r-pa). the provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the faa to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as canada, germany and the united kingdom, have done.[69] shuster\\'s bill, the aviation innovation, reform, and reauthorization (airr) act,[70] expired in the house at the end of the 114th congress.[71]\\nthe house t&i committee began the new reauthorization process for the faa in february 2017. it is expected that the committee will again urge congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. shuster has additional support from president trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the u.s. air control system is \"....totally out of whack.\"[72]\\n'"

              "' the airbus a320 family is a series of narrow-body airliners developed and produced by airbus. the a320 was launched in march 1984, first flew on 22 february 1987, and was introduced in april 1988 by air france. the first member of the family was followed by the longer a321 (first delivered in january 1994), the shorter a319 (april 1996), and the even shorter a318 (july 2003). final assembly takes place in toulouse in france; hamburg in germany; tianjin in china since 2009; and in mobile, alabama in the united states since april 2016. the twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either cfm56 or iae v2500 turbofans, except the cfm56/pw6000 powered a318. the family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners. variants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5 t (150,000 to 206,000 lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940 km (3,100–3,750 nmi) range. the 31.4 m (103 ft) long a318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers. the 124-156 seat a319 is 33.8 m (111 ft) long. the a320 is 37.6 m (123 ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers. the 44.5 m (146 ft) a321 offers 185 to 230 seats. the airbus corporate jets are business jet versions. in december 2010, airbus announced the re-engined a320neo (new engine option), which entered service with lufthansa in january 2016. with more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy. earlier a320s are now called a320ceo (current engine option). american airlines is the largest a320 operator with 459 aeroplanes in its fleet.[b] in october 2019, the a320 family surpassed the boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner. as of august 2022[update], a total of 16,622 a320s had been ordered and 10,474 delivered, of which 9,824 aircraft were in service with more than 340 operators. the global a320 fleet had completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service. the a320ceo initially competed with the 737 classic and the md-80, then their successors, the 737 next generation and the md-90, while the 737 max is boeing\\'s response to the a320neo. when airbus designed the a300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against boeing and douglas (later mcdonnell douglas), two established us aerospace manufacturers. from the moment of formation, airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the airbus a300b in support of this long-term goal. prior to the service introduction of the first airbus airliners, engineers within airbus had identified nine possible variations of the a300 known as a300b1 to b9. a 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the a300b10. it was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range airbus a310. airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and mcdonnell douglas dc-9. plans from a number of european aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful bac one-eleven, and to replace the 737-200 and dc-9. germany\\'s mbb (messerschmitt-bölkow-blohm), british aircraft corporation, sweden\\'s saab and spain\\'s casa worked on the europlane, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft. it was abandoned after intruding on a310 specifications. vfw-fokker, dornier and hawker siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs. the design within the jet study that was carried forward was the jet2 (163 passengers), which then became the airbus s.a1/2/3 series (single aisle), before settling on the a320 name for its launch in 1984. previously, hawker siddeley had produced a design called the hs.134 \"airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the hs.121 (formerly dh.121) trident, which shared much of the general arrangement of the later jet3 study design. the name \"airbus\" at the time referred to a bea requirement, rather than to the later international programme. in june 1977 a new joint european transport (jet) programme was set up, established by british aerospace (bae), aerospatiale, dornier and fokker. it was based at the then bae (formerly vickers) site in weybridge, surrey, uk. although the members were all of airbus\\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from airbus. this project was considered the forerunner of airbus a320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two cfm56s. it would have a cruise speed of mach 0.84 (faster than the boeing 737). the programme was later transferred to airbus, leading up to the creation of the single-aisle (sa) studies in 1980, led by former leader of the jet programme, derek brown. the group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called sa1, sa2 and sa3. although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the a319, a320 and a321, respectively. the single-aisle programme created divisions within airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet rather than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the west germans, particularly lufthansa. however, works proceeded, and the german carrier would eventually order the twinjet. in february 1981 the project was re-designated a320, with efforts focused on the blueprint formerly designated sa2. during the year, airbus worked with delta air lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. the a320 would carry 150 passengers over 5,280 or 3,440 km (2,850 or 1,860 nmi) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only. the -200 had the centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430 l (3,429 to 5,154 imp gal). they would measure 36.04 and 39.24 m (118 ft 3 in and 128 ft 9 in), respectively. airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7 m (12 ft 2 in) internal width, compared to boeing\\'s 3.45 m (11 ft 4 in). although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. the a320 wing went through several design stages, eventually measuring 33.91 m (111 ft 3 in). the uk, france and west germany wanted responsibility over final assembly and its associated work, known as \"work-share arguments\". the germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the british wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. in the end, british work-share was increased from that of the two previous airbuses. france was willing to commit to launch aid, or subsidies, while the germans were more cautious. the uk government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling, requested by bae and estimated at £250 million; it was postponed for three years. on 1 march 1984, the british government and bae agreed that £50 million would be paid, whether the a320 flew or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold. in 1984, the program cost was then estimated at £2 billion ($2.8 billion) by flight international, equivalent to £7 billion today. the programme was launched on 2 march 1984. at the time, airbus had 96 orders. : 48 air france was its first customer to sign a \"letter of intent\" for 25 a320s and options for 25 more at the 1981 paris air show. in october 1983, british caledonian placed seven firm orders, bringing total orders to more than 80. cyprus airways became the first customer to place an order for v2500-powered a320s in november 1984, followed by pan am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in january 1985, and then inex adria. : 49 one of the most significant orders occurred when northwest airlines placed an order for 100 a320s in october 1986, powered by cfm56 engines, later confirmed at the 1990 farnborough airshow. : 49–50 during a320 development, airbus considered propfan technology, which was backed by lufthansa. at the time unproven, the technology essentially consisted of a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering turbofan speeds and turboprop economics; ultimately, airbus stuck with turbofans. power on the a320 was to be supplied by two cfm56-5-a1s rated at 25,000 lbf (111.2 kn). it was the only engine available until the arrival of the iae v2500, offered by international aero engines, a group composed of rolls-royce plc, pratt & whitney, japanese aero engine corporation, fiat and mtu. the first v2500 variant, the v2500-a1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kn), hence the name. it is 4% more efficient than the cfm56, with cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption for the -a5 at 0.574 and 0.596 lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9 g/kn/s) for the cfm56-5a1. in the presence of then-french prime minister jacques chirac and the prince and princess of wales, the first a320 was rolled out of the final assembly line at toulouse on 14 february 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 february in 3 hours and 23 minutes. the flight test programme took 1,200 hours over 530 flights. european joint aviation authorities (jaa) certification was awarded on 26 february 1988. : 50 the first a320 was delivered to air france on 28 march, and began commercial service on 8 april with a flight between paris and berlin via düsseldorf. in 1988, the clean-sheet aircraft program cost was 5.486 billion french francs. the first derivative of the a320 was the airbus a321, also known as the stretched a320, a320-500 and a325. its launch came on 24 november 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured. the aircraft was to be a minimally changed derivative, apart from minor wing modifications and the fuselage stretch itself. the wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications, increasing wing area from 124 m2 (1,330 sq ft) to 128 m2 (1,380 sq ft). the fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), making the a321 6.94 metres (22 ft 9 in) longer than the a320 overall. the length increase required enlarged overwing exits, which were repositioned in front of and behind the wings. the centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate an increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600 kg (21,200 lb), for a total of 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). final assembly for the a321 would be, as a first for any airbus, carried out in germany (then west germany). this came after a dispute between the french, who claimed the move would incur $150 million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditures associated with the new plant, and the germans, who argued that it would be more productive for airbus in the long run. the second production line was located at hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller airbus a319 and a318. for the first time, airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480 million (€475 million) to finance development costs. an additional $180 million (€175 million) was borrowed from the european investment bank and private investors. the maiden flight of the airbus a321 came on 11 march 1993, when the prototype, registration f-wwia, flew with iae v2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with cfm56-5b turbofans, flew in may. lufthansa and alitalia were the first to order the stretched airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft, respectively. the first of lufthansa\\'s v2500-a5-powered a321s arrived on 27 january 1994, while alitalia received its first cfm56-5b-powered aircraft on 22 march. the a319 was the following derivative of the baseline a320. the design was a \"shrink\", with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat sa1, part of the single-aisle studies, which had been shelved as the consortium focused on its bigger siblings. after healthy sales of the a320/a321, airbus focused once more on what was then known as the a320m-7, meaning a320 minus seven fuselage frames. it would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700. the shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12 ft 3 in). consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. the bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height ld3-45 containers. minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft was largely unchanged. power is provided by the cfm56-5a, cfm56-5b, or v2500-a5, derated to 98 kn (22,000 lbf), with option for 105 kn (24,000 lbf) thrust. airbus began offering the new model from 22 may 1992, with the actual launch of the $275 million (€250 million) programme occurring on 10 june 1993; the a319\\'s first customer was ilfc, which signed for six aircraft. on 23 march 1995, the first a319 underwent final assembly at airbus\\' german plant in hamburg, where a321s were also assembled. it was rolled out on 24 august 1995, with the maiden flight taking place the following day. the certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft. certification for the cfm56-5b6/2-equipped variant was granted in april 1996, and qualification for the v2524-a5 started the following month. delivery of the first a319, to swissair, occurred on 25 april 1996; it entered service by month\\'s end. in january 1997, an a319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying the 3,588 nautical miles (6,645 km) great circle route to winnipeg, manitoba from hamburg in 9 hours and 5 minutes. the a319 has proven popular with low-cost airlines such as easyjet, which purchased 172 of them. the a318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between aviation industry corporation of china (avic), singapore technologies aerospace, alenia and airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. the programme was called the ae31x, and covered the 95-seat ae316 and 115- to 125-seat ae317. the former would have had an overall length of 31.3 m (102 ft 8 in), while the ae317 was longer by 3.2 m (10 ft 6 in), at 34.5 m (113 ft 2 in). the engines were to be supplied from two rolls-royce br715s, cfm56-9s, or the pratt & whitney pw6000; with the mtow of 53.3 t (118,000 lb) for the smaller version and 58 t (128,000 lb) for the ae317, the thrust requirement were 77.9–84.6 kn (17,500–19,000 lbf) and 84.6–91.2 kn (19,000–20,500 lbf), respectively. range was settled at 5,200 km (2,800 nmi) and 5,800 km (3,100 nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants. both share a wingspan of 31.0 m (101 ft 8 in) and a flight deck similar to that of the a320 family. costing $2 billion (€1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production was to take place in china. simultaneously, airbus was developing the airbus a318. in early 1998, airbus revealed that it was designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the a320. the ae31x project was terminated by september 1998, and airbus officially announced the a318 at that year\\'s farnborough airshow. the aircraft was the smallest in airbus\\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the airbus a380. first called a319m5 in as early as march 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2 ft 7 in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in) behind. these cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the a319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout. range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100 nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210 nmi) with upcoming sharklets. the 107-seater was launched on 26 april 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft. after three years of design, the maiden flight took place at hamburg on 15 january 2002. tests on the lead engine, the pw6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption. consequently, pratt & whitney abandoned the five-stage high-pressure compressor (hpc) for the mtu-designed six-stage hpc. the 129 order book for the a318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other a320 family members. after 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, jaa certification was obtained for the cfm56-powered variant on 23 may 2003. on 22 july 2003, first delivery for launch customer frontier airlines occurred, entering service before the end of the month. the toulouse blagnac final assembly line builds a320s, whereas the hamburg finkenwerder final assembly line builds a318s, a319s, and a321s. the airbus factory in tianjin, china assembles a319s, a320s, and a321s; a320s and a321s are also assembled at the airbus americas factory in mobile, alabama. airbus produced a total of 42 a320s per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017. as airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing a320neos in 2017; 147 airbus were delivered in 2016 in china, 20% of its production, mostly a320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world\\'s largest market ahead of the us before 2027. in june 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, airbus inaugurated its fourth hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following design thinking principles. by january 2019, mobile was outputting 4.5 a320s per month, raising to five by the end of the year. in september 2019, airbus reached a milestone with the delivery of the 9000th a320-family aircraft to easyjet. in october 2019, airbus inaugurated a highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for a320 family aircraft in hamburg, showcasing an evolution in airbus\\' industrial production system. production rates continue to rise, and airbus aims to reach a production rate of 63 aircraft per month by 2021, which would result in the 10,000th delivery occurring early that year. due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets was reduced in 2020 and airbus cut its monthly production from 60 to 40 a320s. in october 2020, the 500th a320 built in tianjin, an a320neo, was delivered to china southern, twelve years after the final assembly line start in 2008. in 2006, airbus started the a320 enhanced (a320e) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain, with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin. engine improvements that reduced fuel consumption by 1% were made to the a320 in 2007 with the cfm56 tech insertion and in 2008 with the v2500select (one). in 2006, airbus tested three styles of winglets intended to counteract the wing\\'s lift-induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. the first design type to be tested was developed by airbus and based on work done by the awiator programme. the second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by winglet technology, a company based in wichita, kansas, usa. two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign – the prototype a320, which had been retained by airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to jetblue.[citation needed] despite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, airbus announced that those winglets would not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required negated any aerodynamic benefits. on 17 december 2008, airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by aviation partners inc. as part of an a320 modernisation programme using the a320 prototype. airbus launched the sharklet blended winglets during the november 2009 dubai airshow: installation adds 200 kg (440 lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800 km (1,500 nmi), saving approximately us$220,000 and 700 t of co2 per aircraft per year. the 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) tall wingtip devices are manufactured by korean air aerospace division. in december 2011, airbus filed suit in the western district of texas over aviation partners\\' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. airbus\\' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to aviation partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the airbus a320neo. the first sharklet-equipped airbus a320 was delivered to indonesia airasia on 21 december 2012, offering a 450 kg (990 lb) payload and 190 km (100 nmi) range increases over the original aircraft specifications. in 2007, airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley that reduced weight, increased revenue space and improved ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling. it offered a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter, removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin, as well as leds for mood lighting and a new passenger service unit (psu). offering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer psu, the enhanced cabin can be retrofitted. the flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays. the a320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 december 2010, making its first flight on 25 september 2014 and introduced by lufthansa on 25 january 2016. re-engined with cfm international leap-1a or pratt & whitney pw1000g engines and with large sharklets, it was designed to be 15% more fuel efficient. its three variants are based on the previous a319, a320 and a321. airbus received 6,031 orders by march 2018 and delivered 318 by may 2018. the original family was renamed a320ceo, for current engine option. in 2006, airbus was studying a future replacement for the a320 series, tentatively dubbed nsr, for \"new short-range aircraft\". the follow-on aircraft to replace the a320 was named a30x. airbus north america president barry eccleston stated that the earliest the aircraft could have been available was 2017. in january 2010, john leahy, airbus\\'s chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft was unlikely to be constructed before 2024 or 2025. the airbus a320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. after the oil price rises of the 1970s, airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the a320. to that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, a glass cockpit (efis) and a two-crew flight deck. airbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per seat than the v2500-powered a320. a 150-seat a320 burns 11,608 kg (25,591 lb) of jet fuel over 3,984 km (2,151 nmi) (between los angeles and new york city), or 2.43 l/100 km (97 mpg‑us) per seat with a 0.8 kg/l fuel. its wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and md-80. the airbus a320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. its wing sweep is 25 degrees. compared to other airliners of the same class, the a320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156 in) outside diameter, compared to the 3.8 m (148 in) of the boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. its cargo hold can accommodate unit load device containers. the a320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs. its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by casa, which also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts. the a320 flight deck features a full glass cockpit, rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. it is also equipped with an electronic flight instrument system (efis) with side-stick controllers. the a320 has an electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ecam) to give the flight crew information about all of the systems on the aircraft. the only analog instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator. since 2003, the a320 has featured liquid crystal display (lcd) units on the flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (crt) displays. these include both main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which also previously had an analog display. airbus offers an avionics upgrade for older a320 aircraft, the in-service enhancement package, to keep them updated. digital head-up displays are available. the a320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the a310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by bernard ziegler, first airbus ceo henri ziegler\\'s son. the a320 is the world\\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (fbw) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the dassault mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the airbus team which tested fbw on an a300. at its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots. all following airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training. for roger béteille, then airbus president, introducing fly-by-wire with flight envelope protection was one of the most difficult decisions he had ever made, explaining: \"either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.\" early a320s used the intel 80186 and motorola 68010. in 1988, the flight management computer contained six intel 80286 cpus, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory. the suppliers providing turbofan engines for the a320ceo family were cfm international with the cfm56, international aero engines offering its v2500, and pratt & whitney\\'s pw6000 engines available only for the a318, while for the a320neo family are cfm international leap-1a or pratt & whitney pw1000g engines. the cfm56, with unmixed exhaust, is available on all variants. the iae v2500, with mixed exhaust, equips the larger variants. the pw6000 is available on the smallest a318. the joint aviation authorities (jaa) issued the type certificate for the a320 on 26 february 1988. after entering the market on 18 april 1988 with air france, airbus then expanded the a320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat a321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat a319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat a318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003. as of august 2022[update], the global a320 fleet had 99.7 percent operational reliability in the last 12 months and completed more than 157 million flights over 289 million block hours since its entry into service. the a320 family was developed to compete with the boeing 737 classics (-300/-400/-500) and the mcdonnell douglas md-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the boeing 737 next generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. as of 2010, as well as the 737, the a320 family faces competition from embraer\\'s e-195 (to the a318), and the cseries being developed by bombardier to the a318/a319. airbus has delivered 8,605 a320 family aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,056 on firm order (as of 31 december 2018). in comparison, boeing has shipped 10,444 737 series since late 1967, with 8,918 of those deliveries since march 1988, and has a further 4,763 on firm order (as of 31 december 2018). by september 2018, there were 7,251 a320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737ngs, while airbus expected to deliver 3,174 a320neos compared with 2,999 boeing 737 max through 2022. airbus sold the a320 well to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but cfm engines are extremely reliable. the six-month head-start of the a320neo allowed airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before boeing announced the max. the a321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the a321neo is again dominating the 737-9 max, to be joined by the 737-10 max. a checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals. the baseline a320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the a318, to 220, on the a321. they compete with the 737, 757, and 717. because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. today all variants are available as corporate jets. an a319 variant known as a319lr is also developed. military versions like a319 mpa also exists. american airlines is the largest airline operator of the a320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 september 2017. technically, the name \"a320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the a318/a319/a320/a321 family. all variants are able to be etops (extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (easa) and 2006 (faa). with launch of the new airbus a320neo project, the previous members of the airbus a320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"ceo\" name. the airbus a318 is the smallest member of the airbus a320 family. the a318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700 km (3,100 nmi). the aircraft entered service in july 2003 with frontier airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other airbus a320 family variants, allowing existing a320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. it is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the european aviation safety agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as london city airport. relative to other airbus a320 family variants, the a318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31 october 2015[update]. in 2018, the a318 list price was us$77.4 million. the a319 is 3.73 m (12 ft 3 in) shorter than the a320. also known as the a320m-7, it is a shortened, minimum-change version of the a320 with four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing removed. with a similar fuel capacity as the a320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650 km (3,590 nmi), or 6,850 km (3,700 nmi) with the \"sharklets\". four propulsion options available on the a319 are the 23,040–24,800 lbf (102.5–110.3 kn) iae v2500, or the 22,000–27,000 lbf (98–120 kn) cfm56. although identical to those of the a320, these engines are derated because of the a319\\'s lower mtow. the a319 was developed at the request of steven f. udvar-házy, the former president and ceo of ilfc. the a319\\'s launch customer, in fact, was ilfc, which had placed an order for six a319s by 1993. anticipating further orders by swissair and alitalia, airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 june 1993. final assembly of the first a319 began on 23 march 1995 and it was first introduced with swissair in april 1996. the direct boeing competitor is the boeing 737-700. a total of 1,460 of the a319ceo model have been delivered with 24 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017. a 1998 a319 was $35 million new; the value was halved by 2009, and reached scrap levels by 2019. in 2018, the a319 list price was us$92.3 million. the a319cj (rebranded the acj319) is the corporate jet version of the a319. it incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to six additional center tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500 m (41,000 ft). range with eight passengers\\' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (acts) is up to 11,000 kilometres (6,000 nmi). upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard a319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. it was formerly also known as the acj, or airbus corporate jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation acj319. the aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. tyrolean jet services mfg. gmbh & co kg, mjet and reliance industries are among its users. the a319cj competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the boeing 737-700-based boeing business jet (bbj) and embraer lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range gulfstream g650, gulfstream g550 and bombardier\\'s global 6000. it is powered by the same engine types as the a320. the a319cj was used by the escadron de transport, d\\'entraînement et de calibration which is in charge of transportation for france\\'s officials and also by the flugbereitschaft of the german air force for transportation of germany\\'s officials. an acj serves as a presidential or official aircraft of armenia, azerbaijan, brazil, bulgaria, czech republic, germany, italy, malaysia, slovakia, thailand, turkey, ukraine, and venezuela. the a320 series has two variants, the a320-100 and a320-200. only 21 a320-100s were produced. these aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to air inter – later acquired by air france – and british airways as a result of an order from british caledonian made prior to its acquisition. the primary differences with the -100 were the -200\\'s wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity, providing increased range. indian airlines used its first 31 a320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway conditions, which a single-bogie main gear could not manage. powered by two cfm56-5s or iae v2500s with thrust ratings of 98–120 kn (22,000–27,000 lbf), the a320\\'s typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300 nmi / 6,100 km. a total of 4,512 of the a320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017. the closest boeing competitor is the 737-800. in 1988, the value of a new a320 was $30 million, reaching $40 million by the end of the 1990s, a 30% increase lower than the inflation, it dipped to $37 million after 2001, then peaked to $47 million in 2008, and stabilised at $40–42 million until the transition to the a320neo. in 2018, its list price was us$101.0 million. as the a320 was beginning operations in 1988, the a321 was launched as its first derivative the same year. the a321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22 ft 9 in), with a 4.27 m (14 ft 0 in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67 m (8 ft 9 in) rear plug. the a321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600 kg (21,200 lb) to 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). to maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4 m2 (43 sq ft), to 128 m2 (1,380 sq ft). the maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 march 1993. the a321-100 entered service in january 1994 with lufthansa. as the a321-100 range was less than the a320, development of the heavier and longer range a321-200 began in 1995. the higher range was achieved through higher thrust engines (v2533-a5 or cfm56-5b3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990 l (790 us gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold. its fuel capacity was increased to 30,030 l (7,930 us gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). it first flew in december 1996 and entered service with monarch airlines in april 1997. the a321\\'s closest boeing competitors are the 737-900/900er, and the 757-200. a total 1,562 of the a321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 september 2017. in 2018, the a321 list price was us$118.3 million. a programme to convert a320 and a321 aircraft into freighters was set up by airbus freighter conversion gmbh. airframes would be converted by elbe flugzeugwerke gmbh (efw) in dresden, germany, and zhukovsky, russia. the launch customer aercap signed a firm contract on 16 july 2008 to convert 30 of aercap\\'s passenger a320/a321s into a320/a321p2f (passenger to freighter). however, on 3 june 2011, airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service. on 17 june 2015 st aerospace signed agreements with airbus and efw for a collaboration to launch the a320/a321 passenger-to-freighter (p2f) conversion programme. in august 2019, qantas was announced as the launch operator for the a321p2f converted freighter, for australia post, with up to three aircraft to be introduced in october 2020. titan airways received their first a321p2f in january 2021 which was converted at singapore seletar airport, the airline has two more a321p2f\\'s that are yet to be converted. the initial converted aircraft first flew on 22 january 2020, to be delivered to vallair, and it secured easa supplementary type certificate in february. it should replace older converted boeing 757s with 14 positions on the main deck and 10 on the lower, lifting up to 27.9 t (62,000 lb) over 4,300 km (2,300 nmi). airbus sees a market for 1,000 narrowbody conversions over the 2020-2040 period. on 27 october 2020, the first a321p2f was delivered to launch operator qantas airways, with windows and exit doors removed, and a large hydraulically actuated main cargo door installed. after efw began the first a320 conversion in march 2021, the a320p2f made its maiden three-hour flight on 8 december from singapore. the aircraft was first delivered in 2006, and its first cargo operator will be nairobi-based astral aviation from the second quarter of 2022, leased from middle eastern lessor vaayu group. the a320p2f received its supplemental type certification at the end of march 2022. the a320p2f is the best option for express domestic and regional operations. the freighter can accommodate up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900 nautical miles and offers space for 14 large containers/pallets on the main deck and 10 ld3-type containers on the lower deck. the indian defence ministry greenlit the modification by the defence research and development organisation of six air india a320s into airborne early warning and control planes for rs 10,500 crore (us$142 million). they are to complement the two indian-built netra and three israeli-and-russian-made phalcons of the indian air force. as of august 2022[update], there were 9,824 a320 family aircraft in commercial service with over 330 operators. the five largest operators were american airlines, operating 459, china eastern airlines with 358, easyjet 327, china southern airlines 309 and indigo 260. aircraft in operation include 58 a318, 1,361 a319 (1,352 ceo + 9 neo), 5,850 a320 (4,303 ceo + 1,547 neo) and 2,555 a321 (1,737 ceo + 818 neo) aircraft. all 2,374 delivered a320neo family aircraft were in service, while 650 a320ceo family aircraft consisting of 22 a318s, 132 a319s, 449 a320s and 47 a321s were out of service through retirement or write-off. air france, british airways, and frontier airlines are the only operators to have operated all four variants of the a320ceo family. middle east airlines received two milestone aircraft. the first was an a320ceo with manufacturer serial number (msn) 5,000 on 20 january 2012. eight years later, on 9 october 2020, the airline received msn 10,000, an a321neo, at the celebration of its 75th anniversary. the a320ceo family was the fastest-selling airliner from 2005 to 2007. its successor, the a320neo family, improved on this with 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year in 2011. in november 2013, the a320 family aircraft reached 10,000 orders. in october 2019, the a320 family became the highest-selling airliner family with 15,193 orders, surpassing the boeing 737\\'s total of 15,136. in august 2021, the a320 family passed the 10,000 delivery mark, 33 years after its introduction, versus 50 years for the boeing 737, which passed the 10,000 delivery mark in march 2018. on 16 december 2021, the last member of the a320ceo family, an a321ceo (msn 10315), was delivered from the assembly line airbus mobile in alabama. in july 2022, total orders for the a320neo family reached 8,502, exceeding the total orders for the a320ceo family of 8,120. as of september 2022[update], a total of 10,516 a320 family aircraft had been delivered, with 20 a320ceos (2 a319s, 11 a320s and 7 a321s) remaining in the backlog. in the first nine months of 2022, airbus delivered 340 a320 family aircraft, comprising a320neo variants only. the a320 family backlog was over the 6,000 mark again, with a321s accounting for 60% and total orders reached 16,631, whereas cancellations incurred during the boeing 737 max groundings brought total orders for the 737 slightly up to 15,302 aircraft, of which 11,117 had been delivered. data as of 30 september 2022[update]. across the entire a320 family, 159 major aviation accidents and incidents have occurred, including 47 hull loss accidents (the latest being pakistan international airlines flight 8303 on 22 may 2020), for a total of 1393 fatalities. the a320 family has experienced 50 incidents in which several flight displays were lost. as of 2015, the airbus a320 family had experienced 0.12 fatal hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs and 0.26 total hull loss accidents for every million takeoffs. related development aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era related lists an airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. in some countries, the us in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation. operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters. the terms aerodrome, airfield, and airstrip also refer to airports, and the terms heliport, seaplane base, and stolport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft. in colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. however, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. in some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements. that is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. in jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. in us technical/legal usage, landing area is used instead of aerodrome, and airport means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\". an airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. an airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up. an international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.[citation needed] smaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than 1,000 m (3,300 ft). larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) or longer. skyline airport in inkom, idaho has a runway that is only 122 m (400 ft) long. in the united states, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the far landing and takeoff field lengths. these include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff. the longest public-use runway in the world is at qamdo bamda airport in china. it has a length of 5,500 m (18,045 ft). the world\\'s widest paved runway is at ulyanovsk vostochny airport in russia and is 105 m (344 ft) wide. as of 2009[update], the cia stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the us, the us having the most in the world. most of the world\\'s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport\\'s operation. for example, in the uk the state-owned british airports authority originally operated eight of the nation\\'s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the spanish ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just heathrow. germany\\'s frankfurt airport is managed by the quasi-private firm fraport. while in india gmr group operates, through joint ventures, indira gandhi international airport and rajiv gandhi international airport. bengaluru international airport and chhatrapati shivaji international airport are controlled by gvk group. the rest of india\\'s airports are managed by the airports authority of india. in pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the pakistan civil aviation authority except for sialkot international airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in pakistan and south asia[citation needed]. in the us, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the los angeles world airports authority that oversees several airports in the greater los angeles area, including los angeles international airport[citation needed]. in canada, the federal authority, transport canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. now most airports in canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned. many us airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. all us commercial airport runways are certified by the faa under the code of federal regulations title 14 part 139, \"certification of commercial service airports\" but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the faa. despite the reluctance to privatize airports in the us (contrary to the faa sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (goco) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world. the airport & airway trust fund (aatf) was created by the airport and airway development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the united states. airport improvement program (aip), facilities and equipment (f&e), and research, engineering, and development (re&d) are the three major accounts of federal aviation administration which are financed by the aatf, as well as pays for the faa\\'s operation and maintenance (o&m) account. the funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts. airports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports. aeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property. landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight. passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket.[citation needed] aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there. every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, john f kennedy airport in new york city charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight. non-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. it includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising. concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange. car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. o\\'hare international airport in chicago charges $2 per hour for every car. airports are divided into landside and airside zones. the landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities. the airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger\\'s destination. most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity. a terminal is a building with passenger facilities. small airports have one terminal. large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like amsterdam airport schiphol still have one terminal. the terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane. the following facilities are essential for departing passengers: the following facilities are essential for arriving passengers: for both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as jet bridges or airstairs. there also needs to be a baggage handling system, to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim. the area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an apron or ramp (or incorrectly, \"the tarmac\"). airports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. however, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. international flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel. \"floating airports\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology. airport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. since the september 11 attacks and the real id act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before. most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. these include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the us amounted to $4.2 billion in 2015. prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. however, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". this term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers\\' suggested retail price (msrp) but are almost never discounted.[citation needed] many new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security. airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. planners also install artworks next to the airport\\'s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores. apart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport. some airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers. major airports in such countries as russia and japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. the smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in japan. a slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. an even larger type is provided by the company yotel. airports may also contain premium and vip services. the premium and vip services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. these services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline\\'s clubs. premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline\\'s frequent flyer program. this can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines. sometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage. airline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, wi-fi and internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs. airlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities. in addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air. cargo terminal facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies. every cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. the landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. in addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment. airports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station. many large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance frankfurt airport, amsterdam airport schiphol, london heathrow airport, tokyo haneda airport, tokyo narita airport, london gatwick airport and london stansted airport. it is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. some examples of this would include the airtrain jfk at john f. kennedy international airport in new york, link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown seattle to seattle–tacoma international airport, and the silver line t at boston\\'s logan international airport by the massachusetts bay transportation authority (mbta). such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (\\'freeways\\' or \\'motorways\\') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop. the distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. it is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. some airports like hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport and london stansted airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as john f. kennedy international airport, mexico city international airport and london gatwick airport. there are three types of surface that aircraft operate on: air traffic control (atc) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. at the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions. a \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. a \"non-towered\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport\\'s common traffic advisory frequency (ctaf) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. the ctaf may be a universal integrated community (unicom), multicom, flight service station (fss), or tower frequency. the majority of the world\\'s airports are small facilities without a tower. not all towered airports have 24/7 atc operations. in those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. remote and virtual tower (rvt) is a system in which atc is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself. air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations. the busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with clearance delivery, apron control, and/or other specialized atc stations. ground control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"movement areas\", except the traffic on runways. this includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. ground control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. when a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from tower to ground control. tower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft\\'s position in 3d space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. they coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic. at all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the us) is possible. they may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. there is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. and due to the so-called slot-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. if for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. for smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ils equipment, things are very different though. generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). each leg is named (see diagram), and atc directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000 ft (244 or 305 m) above ground level (agl). standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. one of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. the predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision. at controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. while this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. the system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air. there are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. a visual approach slope indicator (vasi) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. some airports are equipped with a vhf omnidirectional range (vor) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. vors are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (dme) to determine the distance to the vor. vors are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. in poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ils) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. the number of instrument approaches based on the use of the global positioning system (gps) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings. larger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (par), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. the aircraft\\'s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing. airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts. many airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog. on runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or als). low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs. along taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway\\'s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline. weather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. in the us and canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an awos, asos, or awss, a human observer or a combination of the two. these weather observations, predominantly in the metar format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (atis), via the atc or the flight service station. planes take-off and land into the wind to achieve maximum performance. because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway. most airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.[citation needed] some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport. among the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are: the length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"turnaround time\". airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft. like industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. with many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service. to manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: cmms (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company\\'s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized. aviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. the crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities. hazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. the fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). in adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. for waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings. many airports are built near open fields or wetlands. these tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence. some airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas. an airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. these locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the faa in the us) and airport administrators. during the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as delta air lines flight 191. microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes\\' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event. some airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. these surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field. airports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. these use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport\\'s traffic. at airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base\\'s operations. aircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. noise can have other health effects as well. other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport. the construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.[citation needed] the construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. for example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. in addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land. [citation needed] airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now. a temperature rise of 2oc – consistent with the paris agreement - would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding. if global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation. some of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. these reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport. a 2019 report from the cooperative research programs of the us transportation research board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction initiatives. small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs. a growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use. the national renewable energy lab has shown this can be done safely. this can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels. [clarification needed] the world\\'s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at kochi, india. another airport known for considering environmental concerns is seymour airport in the galapagos islands. an airbase, sometimes referred to as an air station or airfield, provides basing and support of military aircraft. some airbases, known as military airports, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. for example, raf brize norton in the uk has a terminal that caters to passengers for the royal air force\\'s scheduled flights to the falkland islands. some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same atc facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. bardufoss airport, bardufoss air station in norway and pune airport in india are examples of this. an aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. after their development in world war i, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during world war ii. most airports in the united states are designated \"private-use airports\" meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager). airports are uniquely represented by their iata airport code and icao airport code. most airport names include the location. many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., charles de gaulle airport, george bush intercontinental airport, lennart meri airport, o.r. tambo international airport, soekarno–hatta international airport), a monarch (e.g. chhatrapati shivaji international airport, king shaka international airport), a cultural leader (e.g. liverpool john lennon airport, leonardo da vinci-fiumicino airport, louis armstrong new orleans international airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. sydney kingsford smith airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. allama iqbal international airport) and explorers (e.g. venice marco polo airport). some airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.[citation needed] some airport names include the word \"international\" to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. this includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. port elizabeth international airport). the earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields. the plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. a slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. however, these functioned well only in dry conditions. later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions. the title of \"world\\'s oldest airport\" is disputed. toussus-le-noble airport near paris, france was established in 1907 and has been operating since. college park airport in maryland, us, established in 1909 by wilbur wright serves only general aviation traffic. beijing nanyuan airport in china, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910. it was in operation until september 2019. pearson field airport in vancouver, washington, united states, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of january 2022. hamburg airport opened in january 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. bremen airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an american military field between 1945 and 1949. amsterdam airport schiphol opened on september 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since december 17, 1920, allowing sydney airport—which started operations in january 1920—to claim to be one of the world\\'s oldest continuously operating commercial airports. minneapolis-saint paul international airport in the us opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. it serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. don mueang international airport near bangkok, thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the rome ciampino airport, which opened in 1916. increased aircraft traffic during world war i led to the construction of landing fields. aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope. following the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. one of the earliest such fields was paris – le bourget airport at le bourget, near paris. the first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was hounslow heath aerodrome in august 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by croydon airport in march 1920. in 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at flughafen devau near what was then königsberg, east prussia. the airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft. the first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. these indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. the colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the international civil aviation organization (icao). in the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. this consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft\\'s position on the glideslope. additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction. after world war ii, airport design became more sophisticated. passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. this arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. but it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane. an improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. these run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane\\'s wheels. airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. runways were extended out to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). the fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. the early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. these systems became commonplace in the united states by the 1970s.[citation needed] the malicious use of uavs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (c-uas) technologies such as the aaronia aartos which have been installed on major international airports. airports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. one such example of this is the terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. they are also one of the major elements in movies such as the v.i.p.s, speed, airplane!, airport (1970), die hard 2, soul plane, jackie brown, get shorty, home alone (1990), home alone 2: lost in new york (1992), liar liar, passenger 57, final destination (2000), unaccompanied minors, catch me if you can, rendition and the langoliers. they have also played important parts in television series like lost, the amazing race, america\\'s next top model (season 10), 90 day fiancé, air crash investigation which have significant parts of their story set within airports. in other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. good will hunting. several computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. these include the airport tycoon series, simairport and airport ceo. each civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. this will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby navaids and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary. infraero is responsible for the airports in brazil a comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group airports council international. lists: affiliates avianca s.a. (acronym in spanish for aerovias del continente americano s.a., \"airways of the american continent\") is a colombian airline. it has been the flag carrier of colombia since december 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name scadta. it is headquartered in colombia, with its registered office in barranquilla and its global headquarters in bogotá and main hub at el dorado international airport. avianca is the flagship of a group of ten latin american airlines, who operate as one airline using a codesharing system. avianca is the largest airline in colombia and second largest in latin america, after latam of chile. avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in latin america. prior to the merger with taca in 2010, it was wholly owned by synergy group, a south american holding company established by germán efromovich and specialising in air transport. it is listed on the colombia stock exchange. through scadta, avianca is the world\\'s second oldest extant airline after klm, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in december 2019. it is the oldest airline in the western hemisphere. it became an official member of star alliance on june 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement of its invitation to join the alliance. on may 10, 2020, avianca filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in new york city, and liquidated its subsidiary avianca perú, due to the covid-19 pandemic crisis. the airline traces its history back to december 5, 1919, in the city of barranquilla, colombia. colombians ernesto cortissoz alvarez-correa (the first president of the airline), rafael maría palacio, cristóbal restrepo, jacobo correa and aristides noguera and germans werner kämmerer, stuart hosie and albert tietjen founded the colombo-german company, called sociedad colombo-alemana de transportes aéreos or scadta. the company accomplished their first flight on september 5, 1920 between barranquilla and the nearby town of puerto colombia using a junkers f.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. the flight was piloted by german helmuth von krohn. this and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. there were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of 850 km (528 mi) which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. using these floats, helmuth von krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over colombia on october 20, 1920, following the course of the magdalena river; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water. soon after the airline was founded, german scientist and philanthropist peter von bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the colombian government to operate the country\\'s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. this new contract allowed scadta to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. by the mid-1920s, scadta started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in venezuela and the united states. in 1924, the aircraft that both ernesto cortissoz and helmuth von krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as bocas de ceniza in barranquilla, killing them. in the early 1940s, peter von bauer sold his shares in the airline to the us-owned pan am. on june 14, 1940, in the city of barranquilla, scadta, under ownership by united states businessmen, merged with regional colombian airline saco, forming the new aerovías nacionales de colombia s.a. or avianca. five colombians participated in this: rafael maría palacio, jacobo a. corea, cristobal restrepo, and aristides noguera, as well as german citizens albert teitjen, werner kaemerer and stuart hosie, while the post of first president of avianca was filled by martín del corral. avianca claims scadta\\'s history as its own. in 1946, avianca began flights to quito, lima, panama city, miami, new york city and europe, using douglas dc-4s and c-54 skymasters. in 1951, avianca acquired lockheed constellations and super constellations. in 1956, the company transported the colombian delegation to the melbourne olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel. during the 1960s, the company built the avianca building in bogotá, designed by the architect germán samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of santander park. in 1961, avianca leased two boeing 707s to operate its international routes and on november 2, 1961, it acquired its own boeing 720s. in 1976, avianca became the first latin american airline to continuously operate the boeing 747-100. three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations. in 1981, avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the terminal puente aéreo, which was eventually inaugurated by president julio césar turbay ayala. avianca\\'s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving cali, medellín, miami and new york. in 1994, avianca, the regional carrier sam and the helicopter operator helicol merged, beginning avianca\\'s new system of operations. this arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (avianca cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet made up of boeing 767s, boeing 757s, md-83s, fokker 50s, and bell helicopters. in 1996, avianca postal services became deprisa, which provided various mail services. on december 10, 1998, avianca officially opened its new hub in bogotá, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country\\'s capital, for the benefit of colombian and international travelers between south america, europe and north america. after the september 11 attacks, avianca, sam, and their major rival aces joined efforts to create the alianza summa, which began merged operations on may 20, 2002 to offer a more efficient service, with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. however, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets, forced the alliance to be disband. in november 2003, the alianza summa was disbanded, aces was liquidated altogether and sam was acquired to be a regional carrier under avianca\\'s brand. on december 10, 2004, avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the brazilian consortium, synergy group and the national federation of coffee growers of colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for us$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy. under this plan, avianca was bought by synergy group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries oceanair and vip. the company\\'s full legal name was changed from aerovías nacionales de colombia (national airways of colombia) to aerovías del continente americano (airways of the american continent), retaining the acronym avianca. on february 28, 2005, avianca presented its new logo and livery. in october 2009, it was announced that avianca would merge with taca airlines. this created aviancataca holding, which instantly became one of the region\\'s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations. in november 2009, the airline\\'s chief executive fabio villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its fokker 50 and fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less. on january 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 airbus a318s leased from gecas. the aircraft were delivered from february to april 2011. on november 10, 2010, star alliance announced that avianca (and its merger counterpart, taca) were full members in 2012. due to avianca\\'s entry into star alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with delta air lines and began a new codeshare agreement with united airlines. taca had been codesharing with united airlines since 2006. on june 21, 2012, avianca and taca were both officially admitted into star alliance. on march 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from aviancataca holding to avianca holdings. taca and all other aviancataca airlines changed their brand to avianca on may 28, 2013. as of 2017, avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from miami with 16, second only to american airlines. in august 2018, avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. this resulted in the cancellation of several flights within colombia. likewise, due to the stoppage of acdac pilots in 2017, only in october 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored. on march 1, 2019, avianca launched a subsidiary named avianca express, which operates atr-72s on short regional flights within colombia. avianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on december 31, 2019. in response to the global outbreak of covid-19, the colombian government\\'s lockdown suspended avianca\\'s domestic and international operations; most of the company’s 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late march and may outside of repatriation missions. as a result of this temporary cessation of business, the airline had seen 80% of its revenue slashed. avianca holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on may 10, 2020 as a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation prior to and during the crisis. the airline holding liquidated their subsidiary avianca perú the same day. the debtors requested and were granted joint administration of the cases under case no. 20-11133. the airline had accumulated a total debt of usd $7.3 billion at the end of 2019. avianca released and implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their airbus a320s, simplifying their fleet to only the a320 family and boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding. in november 2021, avianca holdings announced they would move their legal address from panama to the united kingdom, and that they would change their name to avianca group. their global headquarters remains in bogotá. on november 2, 2021, avianca\\'s reorganization plan was approved by the court, and on december 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, avianca emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history. on april 29, 2022, avianca announced that it would acquire low-cost competitor viva air colombia and its subsidiary viva air perú. on may 11, 2022, it was announced that avianca would merge with gol linhas aéreas inteligentes to form the abra group, and that avianca will be the acquiring company. avianca\\'s headquarters are on avenida el dorado and between carrera 60 and gobernación de cundinamarca, located in the ciudad salitre area of bogotá. the building is located next to the gran estación. its previous head office was at avenida el dorado no. 93-30. avianca\\'s hubs are in bogotá, san salvador, cali, cartagena and medellín. its focus cities are barranquilla, san josé, and miami, in the latter of which avianca is the largest foreign carrier by number of passengers. avianca has codeshare agreements with the following airlines: avianca has an interline agreement with boliviana de aviación. the frequent-flyer program of avianca and its subsidiaries is lifemiles. this program is designed to reward customer loyalty for the airline, travel, and retail sectors. lifemiles members can earn miles every time they fly with avianca, star alliance member airlines, gol airlines, aeromexico, and iberia. the program was launched in 2011, as the merger of avianca and taca, replacing its former program aviancaplus. lifemiles has been awarded 14 freddie awards for it\\'s outstanding performance and best promotions in the americas during the last 9 years. lifemiles has four elite tiers: as of october 2022[update], the avianca fleet consists of the following aircraft: avianca\\'s first boeing 787 dreamliner was delivered on december 17, 2014, and launched its first service on january 16, 2015, between bogotá and new york city. over the years, avianca had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including: the airline suffered a few incidents during the 1980s and early 1990s. the deadliest of those incidents was avianca flight 011, which crashed in 1983. in its recent history, the company has won different awards: media related to avianca at wikimedia commons flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight). this can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement. many things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes. the engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles. humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in air. an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. an aerostat\\'s main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached. aerostats are so named because they use \"aerostatic\" lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. by contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass. some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. this is termed gliding. some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. this is termed soaring. however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. this is termed powered flight. the only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. the extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals. each of these groups\\' wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight. the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods. bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see bat flight). however, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. \"flying\" snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground. flying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. it is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. the longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds. most birds fly (see bird flight), with some exceptions. the largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era. the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.[citation needed] most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage. among living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 meters (11 feet); the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at 21 kilograms (46 pounds). most species of insects can fly as adults. insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips. mechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. these machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. gliders are capable of unpowered flight. another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. in an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. there are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it. supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground, and is frequently startling. this shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound. hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz. some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. this is termed ballistic flight. examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc. essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc. spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites. a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth. once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. in 2018, researchers at massachusetts institute of technology (mit) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an \"ionic wind\" also known as electroaerodynamic thrust. many human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears, the boomerang in australia, the hot air kongming lantern, and kites. george cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century, and in the second half of the 19th century otto lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. his work was replicated and extended by the wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights. spaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h. goddard. the first orbital spaceflight was in 1957, and yuri gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961. there are different approaches to flight. if an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. a heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding. some vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example rockets and harrier jump jets. finally, momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects. forces relevant to flight are these forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur. a fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight. this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine. the forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring v/stol aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed. in the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction. aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with newton\\'s third law of motion. lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). while common meanings of the word \"lift\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. when an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. on high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road. for a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement. therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. the process which creates lift also causes some drag. aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. for sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. in general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift. however, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. the lift to drag ratio is the l/d ratio, pronounced \"l over d ratio.\" an airplane has a high l/d ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. the lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, cl/cd. the lift coefficient cl is equal to the lift l divided by the (density r times half the velocity v squared times the wing area a). [cl = l / (a * .5 * r * v^2)] the lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity v is not a linear function. compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces. the drag coefficient cd is equal to the drag d divided by the (density r times half the velocity v squared times the reference area a). [cd = d / (a * .5 * r * v^2)] lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. a greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. however a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. lift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. the only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. the buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - archimedes\\' principle holds for air just as it does for water. a cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. if the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. if an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise. thrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the earth\\'s standard acceleration g 0 {\\\\displaystyle g_{0}} ). it is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft). if the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in gs), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required. if the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible. flight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. the three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle\\'s center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (see tait-bryan rotations for an explanation). the control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. \"a tail\"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive dihedral angle\" which gives inherent roll stabilization. to create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust. propulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel. the range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion. for powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used. all animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off. vehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. some aircraft such as helicopters and harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally. navigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, gps, loran, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter). in aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground. the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (vfr) or the instrument flight rules (ifr). in the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. in the vfr case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. this may be supplemented using radio navigation aids. a guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective. a conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft\\'s direction in flight. aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed. in the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems. collision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions. air safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. it can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel. flight travel guide from wikivoyage the federal aviation administration (faa) is the largest transportation agency of the u.s. government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country as well as over surrounding international waters. : 12, 16 its powers include air traffic management, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of u.s. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the faa by authority of the international civil aviation organization. created in august 1958 (1958-08), the faa replaced the former civil aeronautics administration (caa) and later became an agency within the u.s. department of transportation. the faa\\'s roles include: the faa operates five \"lines of business\". their functions are: the faa is headquartered in washington, d.c. and also operates the william j. hughes technical center in atlantic city, new jersey, for support and research, and the mike monroney aeronautical center in oklahoma city, oklahoma, for training. the faa has nine regional administrative offices: the air commerce act of may 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the federal government\\'s regulation of civil aviation. this landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. the act charged the secretary of commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. the newly created aeronautics branch, operating under the department of commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight. in fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the u.s. department of commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. it took over the building and operation of the nation\\'s system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the post office department. the department of commerce improved aeronautical radio communications—before the founding of the federal communications commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today—and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation. the aeronautics branch was renamed the bureau of air commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the department. as commercial flying increased, the bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (atc) along the airways. in 1936, the bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the atc system. the pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities. in 1938, the civil aeronautics act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the commerce department to a new independent agency, the civil aeronautics authority. the legislation also expanded the government\\'s role by giving the caa the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve. president franklin d. roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the civil aeronautics administration (caa) and the civil aeronautics board (cab). caa was responsible for atc, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. cab was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. the caa was part of the department of commerce. the cab was an independent federal agency. on the eve of america\\'s entry into world war ii, caa began to extend its atc responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. this expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. the application of radar to atc helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. in 1946, meanwhile, congress gave caa the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation\\'s civil airports. the approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions—most notably the 1956 grand canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the federal aviation act of 1958. this legislation passed the caa\\'s functions to a new independent body, the federal aviation agency. the act also transferred air safety regulation from the cab to the faa, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. the faa\\'s first administrator, elwood r. quesada, was a former air force general and adviser to president eisenhower. the same year witnessed the birth of the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), which was created in response to the soviet union (ussr) launch of the first manmade satellite. nasa assumed naca\\'s aeronautical research role. in 1967, a new u.s. department of transportation (dot) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. the federal aviation agency\\'s name changed to the federal aviation administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., federal highway administration, federal railroad administration, the coast guard, and the saint lawrence seaway commission) within dot. the faa administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the secretary of transportation. new programs and budget requests would have to be approved by dot, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president. at the same time, a new national transportation safety board took over the civil aeronautics board\\'s (cab) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. cab was merged into dot with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares. the faa gradually assumed additional functions. the hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. in response to the hijackings on september 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the department of homeland security. the faa became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. during the 1960s and 1970s, the faa also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying. by the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. this system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the airline deregulation act of 1978 phased out the cab\\'s economic regulation of the airlines. a nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. during the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. in 1994, the faa shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment. in 1979, congress authorized the faa to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented. in the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the faa\\'s development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. in 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within dot headquarters. the agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the september 11 attacks. in december 2000, an organization within the faa called the air traffic organization, (ato) was set up by presidential executive order. this became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the united states and for the new york (atlantic) and oakland (pacific) oceanic areas. it is a full member of the civil air navigation services organisation. the faa issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the amt awards), a flight instructor (gold seal certification), a 50-year aviator (wright brothers master pilot award), a 50-year mechanic (charles taylor master mechanic award) or as a proficient pilot. the latter, the faa \"wings program\", provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (basic, advanced, and master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last wings award, or \"phase\". for more information on all these programs, visit www.faasafety.gov or inquire at an faa flight standards district office (fsdo). for more information on the wings program, please see faa advisory circular ac 61-91j. the faa encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety. the faa safety team, or faasteam, works with volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide. for more information, inquire at an faa flight standards district office (fsdo). on march 18, 2008, the faa ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that southwest airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections. the faa exercises surprise red team drills on national airports annually. on october 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism from nick bilton of the new york times, the faa announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). implementation initially varied among airlines. the faa expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to federal communications commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. from a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft\\'s high speed. however, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. if an air carrier provides wi-fi service during flight, passengers may use it. short-range bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used. in july 2014, in the wake of the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17, the faa suspended flights by u.s. airlines to ben gurion airport during the 2014 israel–gaza conflict for 24 hours. the ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later. the faa reauthorization act of 2018 gives the faa one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers. the first faa licensed orbital human space flight took place on november 15, 2020, carried out by spacex on behalf of nasa. the administrator is appointed for a five-year term. on march 19, 2019, president donald trump announced he would nominate stephen dickson, a former executive and pilot at delta air lines, to be the next faa administrator. on july 24, 2019, the senate confirmed dickson by a vote of 52–40. he was sworn in as administrator by transportation secretary elaine chao on august 12, 2019. on february 16, 2022, dickson announced his resignation as faa administrator, effective march 31, 2022. the faa has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\" retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz, who used to be a special agent with the office of inspector general for the department of transportation and with faa security, is one of the most outspoken critics of faa. rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against southwest airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an associated press story: \"penalties against airlines that violate faa directives should be stiffer. at $25,000 per violation, gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. he also said the faa is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\" other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the faa is expected to operate. the dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. for example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an faa regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel. on july 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the southwest airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the house to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year \"cooling off\" period that faa inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated. the bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word \"customer\" properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the faa. the bill died in a senate committee that year. in september 2009, the faa administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term \"customers\" to refer to only the flying public. in 2007, two faa whistleblowers, inspectors charalambe \"bobby\" boutris and douglas e. peters, alleged that boutris said he attempted to ground southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. this was validated by a report by the department of transportation which found faa managers had allowed southwest airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings in april 2008. jim oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with faa safety rules. oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior faa officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the faa\\'s culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption\". in 2008 the faa proposed to fine southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 southwest and the faa agreed that southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if southwest failed to follow through. in 2014, the faa modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. it launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or vra bids, something that had last been done in 2008. thousands have been picked up, including veterans, cti grads, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires. the move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a cti program. before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. however, the cti program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. the goal of the program was to prepare people for the faa academy in oklahoma city, ok. having a cti certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the air traffic basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into initial qualification training (iqt). all prospective controllers, cti or not, have had to pass the faa academy in order to be hired as a controller. failure at the academy means faa employment is terminated. in january 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an faa control tower operator certificate (cto) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. this was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the faa academy entirely. in the process of promoting diversity, the faa revised its hiring process. the faa later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. however, the \"bio-q\" was not the determinating factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised air traffic standardized aptitude test (atsat). due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised atsat, which has since been validated. in 2015 fox news levied unsubstantiated criticism that the faa discriminated against qualified candidates. in december 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the faa seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under faa rules before they were abruptly changed. the prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the faa is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the cti program. a may 2017 letter from staff of the u.s. house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including nextgen. the letter said the faa initially described nextgen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. in 2015, however, the national research council noted that nextgen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the national airspace system (nas). more precise pbn can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths. a feature of the nextgen program is gps-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. the result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit. as a result of the march 10, 2019 ethiopian airlines flight 302 crash and the lion air flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the boeing 737 max 8 (and in many cases all max variants) due to safety concerns, but the faa declined to ground max 8 aircraft operating in the u.s. on march 12, the faa said that its ongoing review showed \"no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\" some u.s. senators called for the faa to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the ethiopian airlines crash was complete. u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said that \"if the faa identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.\" the faa resisted grounding the aircraft until march 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. by then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane, and by march 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. three major u.s. airlines--southwest, united, and american airlines—were affected by this decision. further investigations also revealed that the faa and boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the faa had retaliated against whistleblowers. a designated engineering representative (der) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 cfr section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (ic). the der system enables the faa to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the faa. qualifications and policies for appointment of designated airworthiness representatives are established in faa order 8100.8, designee management handbook. working procedures for ders are prescribed in faa order 8110.37, designated engineering representative (der) handbook. neither type of der is an employee of either the faa or the united states government. while a der represents the faa when acting under the authority of a der appointment; a der has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a der. neither does the faa provide any indemnification for a der from general tort law. \"the faa cannot shelter or protect ders from the consequences of their findings.\" a dar is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 cfr 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. there are two types of dars: manufacturing, and maintenance. specialized experience – amateur-built and light-sport aircraft dars both manufacturing dars and maintenance dars may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. dar qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in order 8100.8. a continued airworthiness notification to the international community (commonly abbreviated as canic) is a notification from the united states federal aviation administration (faa) to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions. the faa airworthiness directives manual, states the following:8. continued airworthiness notification to the international community (canic). the faa issued a canic to state the continued airworthiness of the boeing 737 max, following the crash of ethiopian airlines flight 302. another canic notified the ungrounding of the max, ending a 20-month grounding. u.s. law requires that the faa\\'s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. on july 18, 2016, president obama signed a second short-term extension of the faa authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day. the 2016 extension (set to expire itself in september 2017) left out a provision pushed by republican house leadership, including house transportation and infrastructure (t&i) committee chairman bill shuster (r-pa). the provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the faa to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as canada, germany and the united kingdom, have done. shuster\\'s bill, the aviation innovation, reform, and reauthorization (airr) act, expired in the house at the end of the 114th congress. the house t&i committee began the new reauthorization process for the faa in february 2017. it is expected that the committee will again urge congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. shuster has additional support from president trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the u.s. air control system is \"....totally out of whack.\" '"
