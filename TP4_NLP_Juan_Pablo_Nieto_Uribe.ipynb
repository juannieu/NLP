The album was released on October 11, 2019 through Spinefarm Records.[9]\\nOpening track \"The Silence of a Sleeping WASP\" is a sequel to \"The Shadow\" from the band\\'s previous album Phantom Amour. Lyrically, the songs deal with Carl Jung\\'s concept of the shadow and how it deals with addiction and alcoholism.[10] The album\\'s title track also deals with themes of addiction, along with depression, anxiety, and co-dependency, among others.[11]\\nI Am polarized critics upon its release.\\nCryptic Rock gave the album a perfect score of 5/5, calling I Am the band\\'s most complete work to date.[6] Distorted Sound gave the album a highly positive review, praising the album\\'s experimental but accessible sound along with Matthews\\'s emotional lyrics.[8]\\nZach Buggy of Dead Press! gave the album an overwhelmingly negative review, saying the aggressiveness of Nocturnal Masquerade and the progressiveness of Phantom Amour have been diluted and \"boiled down into a melting pot of half-baked ideas\" that results in \"a bland, accessible mess.\" Buggy said the band comes off as \"a less obnoxious Five Finger Death Punch, or as metal’s answer to Imagine Dragons.\"[7] Exclaim!\\'s Max Morin also gave an overwhelmingly negative review, saying the album sounds like every metal song on Sirius XM meshed together, resulting in a sound similar to Shinedown and Bring Me the Horizon. Morin claimed the record was Toothgrinder selling out, getting rid of many of its heavier and experimental elements for a \"pop sheen\" and \"radio-friendly production.\" Morin did praise the title track for the confessional lyrics of Justin Matthews and for the djent style riff.[1]\\nAll lyrics are written by Justin Matthews; all music is composed by Toothgrinder.\\nSimon Green (born 30 March 1976), known by his stage name Bonobo, is a British musician, producer, and DJ based in Los Angeles.[1] He debuted with a trip hop aesthetic, and has since explored more upbeat approaches as well as jazz and world music influences. His tranquil electronic sound incorporates the use of organic instrumentation, and is recreated by a full band in live performances.\\nGreen\\'s work has attained a cult following, and he has collaborated with a variety of other artists.\\nGreen debuted in 1999 on the Tru Thoughts compilation When Shapes Join Together.[2] His stage name Bonobo is a reference to the Bonobo chimpanzee species.[3] Following the releases of the EP Scuba, released on Brighton based label Fly Casual Recordings, and the single \"Terrapin\", Bonobo was offered label deals with XL recordings and Mute records, but he chose to remain in Tru Thoughts.[1]\\nHis first album Animal Magic was released on the same label in 2000 to mixed reviews.[4][5] Paul Cooper of Pitchfork stated that it \"breaks no new ground for chill-out\",[6] while PopMatters said Bonobo \"[showcases] smooth breakbeat loops, synth sounds, and aforementioned dub effects. [And his] electronic music draws on live playing.\"[7] Reviewer Dean Carlson also said that the album \"slowly takes shape as a solid debut of narcoleptic downtempo.\"[8] In spite of reactions, Animal Magic has given Bonobo a cult following.[5] Its accompanying compilation album titled \"One Offs...\", was issued in 2002 and contains reworked songs and rarities.\\nIn 2001, Bonobo was signed to Coldcut\\'s label Ninja Tune[1] and in 2003, he released Dial \\'M\\' for Monkey. John Bush of AllMusic stated in a review that Bonobo\\'s influences were drawn more towards alternative rock and world music rather than hip-hop or trip hop.[9] The album tracks \"Pick up\" and \"Flutter\" were featured in the snowboarding game SSX on Tour.[10]\\nIn 2005, Bonobo contributed to the Solid Steel series, with It Came from the Sea.[1] The mix features several exclusive tracks as well as remixes and re-edits. His third album, entitled Days to Come, was released on 2 October 2006. An AllMusic review states that \"[Bonobo] breathes new life into a well-worn genre.\" With the album as well as his future work, he featured vocalists such as Bajka, thus \"adding [an] organic and vibrant musicality that\\'s rare in electronic music.\"[11] Days to Come was voted Best Album of 2006 by Gilles Peterson\\'s listeners.[12] The song \"Nightlite\" appeared on UEFA Champions League 2006–2007,[13] and \"Recurring\" was used in a surfing film broadcast on Fuel TV.[14]\\nThe song \"The Keeper\" featuring vocals by Andreya Triana was released in September 2009 as the lead single from his fourth album Black Sands, released in March 2010.[15] A BBC review by Paul Clarke stated that \"Green has progressed from predominantly sample-based production to more live instrumentation [and] has become equally adept at mastering [...] multi-layered atmospheres.\" in the same review, Clarke has also commented that the songs \"We Could Forever\" \"saddles an Afro-inflected guitar and skittish flute to deep sub-bass\" and \"Kiara\" combines \"oriental strings with cut-up beats.\"[16] After their collaboration for Black Sands, Green produced Andreya Triana\\'s debut album Lost Where I Belong.[17] The song \"Kong\" was used during a scene in an artist\\'s studio in the eighth episode of the second season of House of Cards.[18]\\nIn February 2012, Black Sands Remixed was released on Ninja Tune, featuring tracks from the original Black Sands record remixed by electronic producers such as Machinedrum, Lapalux, Floating Points, and Mark Pritchard.\\nThe first single off the next Bonobo album, \"Cirrus\", was given its worldwide debut on Gilles Peterson\\'s BBC Radio 6 programme on 19 January 2013. The album is titled The North Borders and was set for release on 1 April 2013, but was released early in its digital format after a promotional copy was leaked prior to the planned launch date.[19] The North Borders marked his first UK and US album chart entries, where they respectively reached numbers 34 and 122. The track \"Cirrus\" was featured as the closing song of the pilot episode for the AMC show Halt and Catch Fire.[20]\\nHe produced the song, \"Pulls\" by DELS for his 2014 album Petals Have Fallen, which was released under Big Dada; a sister label of Ninja Tune.[21]\\nBonobo released his sixth album, Migration, in January 2017.[22] In an interview with Billboard, Bonobo said that he conceived the album from \"living and being in various locations\", as he toured extensively and did not \"have a home base for about a year\".[23] The album and the track Bambro Koyo Ganda have been nominated for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album.[24] The album peaked higher in the UK chart (number 5) and in the US (number 59). In 2018, Bonobo\\'s \"Migration\" album also won Album of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards and Bonobo was also nominated for Live Act of the Year.[25]\\nOn 1 July 2019, Bonobo released a new song, \"Linked\", online.[26] \"Linked\" was later nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 62nd Grammy Awards, but lost to \"Got to Keep On\" by The Chemical Brothers.[27]\\nThe following year, Bonobo remixed Michael Kiwanuka\\'s song \"Final Days\".[28]\\nBonobo\\'s seventh studio album Fragments[29] was released on 14 January 2022. Five singles were released ahead of the album\\'s release. The first single, \"Rosewood\", debuted on 6 October 2021, followed by \"Tides\" on 20 October 2021, a collaboration with Jamila Woods. A third single, \"Otomo\", was released on 10 November 2021, a collaboration with O\\'Flynn, followed by \"Shadows\", with Jordan Rakei, on the 1st of December. The fifth and final single, \"From You\", with Joji, was released on 3 January 2022.\\nBonobo\\'s sound is oriented on beats and samples but typically \"soothing\", combining influences ranging from club music to world music.[30] Pitchfork named him a key figure in the 2000s downtempo electronica scene[31] while The Guardian associated him with the recent popularity of \"ambient world electronica\".[32] While his earliest work was firmly based in trip hop,[33] his style soon became more upbeat and delved into genres such as jazz (which has led him to be described as a nu jazz artist) and traditional Indian music. He has collaborated with various artists, including Bajka, Andreya Triana, Erykah Badu, and Rhye who contributed vocals to songs on his last four albums Days to Come, Black Sands, The North Borders, and Migration, respectively.[30] He also performed with Robert Luis of the Tru Thoughts label under the alias of Nirobi and Barakas.[34]\\nWhilst often touring solo, and performing DJ sets and residencies, in 2010 Bonobo opted to start touring with a full band for the Black Sands tour. The band plays live renditions of studio material, with a singer, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist, string section, electronics, and drummer, often with improvisations and solos.[35] His albums employ sampling, for example \\'Behind the Light\\' (from Pick Up EP, 2003) uses a clip of \\'Judy\\' from John Renbourn.[citation needed]\\nProject Blue Fly is a former covert project of the United States Air Force during the Cold War that existed at the Air Force Missile Development Center at Holloman Air Force Base. The aim of the project was to exploit the discovery  of Soviet hardware when it landed in American or allied hands permanently.[1]\\nThese are the results for the 97th edition of the Milan–San Remo cycling classic, raced on March 18, 2006.

The local time was established by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry.[1][2] From 1951 to 1971, the term Karachi Time was again used to denote UTC+05:00 for West Pakistan abbreviated as KART as opposed to Dacca Time (DACT) used in East Pakistan.\\n\\nEdward Henry Heinemann (March 14, 1908 – November 26, 1991) was a military aircraft designer for the Douglas Aircraft Company.\\nHeinemann was born in Saginaw, Michigan. He moved to California as a boy and was raised in Los Angeles. A self-taught engineer, he joined Douglas Aircraft as a draftsman in 1926, but was laid off within a year.  After stints at International Aircraft, Moreland Aircraft, and the first Northrop Corporation, Heinemann rejoined Douglas after it acquired Northrop. Heinemann became Douglas\\'s Chief Engineer in 1936. He remained with the company through 1960, when he left to join Guidance Technology. In 1962 he joined General Dynamics as Corporate Vice President of Engineering.  In this position he oversaw the development of the F-16.  He retired in 1973.\\nThe famed airplane designer Burt Rutan would list Heinemann as among the leading pioneers in aviation who had inspired him to become an aerospace engineer.[1][2]\\nHis approach to aircraft design was uncomplicated, once saying that he simply took the most powerful engine available and designed the aircraft around it.[citation needed]\\nDuring his long career at Douglas, Heinemann designed more than 20 combat aircraft, primarily for the U.S. Navy, including many that became legends in aviation history. His designs included the following aircraft:\\nOne of the first aircraft to be designed by Heinemann was the Moreland M-1 Trainer of 1929, a braced-wing parasol wing monoplane. Due to the 1929 recession only a small number were sold before the company ceased trading in 1933.[4]\\nThe Naval Air Systems Command awards the Edward H. Heinemann Award annually to an individual or group that makes a significant contribution to aircraft design.\\nSiple Station was a research station in Antarctica (75°55′00″S 83°55′00″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff75.916667°S 83.916667°W\\ufeff / -75.916667; -83.916667), established in 1973 by Stanford\\'s STAR Lab, to perform experiments that actively probed the magnetosphere using very low frequency (VLF) waves.[1] Its location was selected to be near the Earth\\'s south magnetic pole, and the thick ice sheet allowed for a relatively efficient dipole antenna at VLF (very low frequency – 3\\xa0kHz range) frequencies. John Katsufrakis of Stanford University was the \"father\" of the station and the VLF experiment sponsored by Stanford.\\nThere were two stations, Siple I and later Siple II, circa 1979, built above the original which was eventually crushed by the ice. The original Siple I station had a four-person winter over crew and the later Siple II station had an eight-person winter over crew.\\nThe Siple II station used a 300\\xa0kW Kato square wound generator powered by a Caterpillar D353 engine to power the VLF (Jupiter) transmitter which transmitted to a receiver in Roberval, Canada. At the time, the Siple II station had the world\\'s longest dipole antenna. Originally 12 miles (19\\xa0km) long, it was subsequently increased to 24 miles (39\\xa0km) and then a second 24-mile (39\\xa0km) antenna running at 90 degrees was added, resulting in a total antenna length of approximately 50 miles and allowing for phased VLF transmissions. Utah State also conducted a high-frequency radar experiment for a few years at the Siple II station.\\nThe Siple II station\\'s house power was provided by two 110\\xa0kW generators (one active, one standby) powered by 3306 Caterpillar engines. The Siple II building complex was a metal Wonder Arch structure approximately 280\\xa0ft (85\\xa0m) long, 44\\xa0ft (13\\xa0m) wide and 24\\xa0ft (7.3\\xa0m) tall. During winter-over operation the facility stored a maximum of approximately 80,000 US gallons (300,000\\xa0l; 67,000\\xa0imp\\xa0gal) of DFA (Diesel Fuel Arctic) in three 25,000-US-gallon (95,000\\xa0l; 21,000\\xa0imp\\xa0gal) fuel bladders.\\nSiple Station was named after Paul Siple, who, as a Boy Scout, was a member of two Byrd expeditions and other Antarctic explorations. The station was closed in 1988 following completion of the program.[1]\\nGöran \"Pisa\" Nicklasson (20 August 1942 – 27 January 2018) was a Swedish footballer.[2]\\nNicklasson played in IFK Göteborg during the 1960s and 1970s in Allsvenskan.

The club was founded in 1876 and membership was restricted to solicitors, who had contributed 50 guineas through subscriptions by the time the club was entering its second year.[2]\\nThe club optimistically entered the FA Cup in 1881-82 as one of four sides from the town (the others being Blackburn Rovers, Blackburn Olympic, and Blackburn Park Road) to do so, despite not having entered the Lancashire Senior Cup in the competition\\'s two years of existence.[3]  The club was drawn to play Bootle F.C. in the first round, and took the lead in the first half, but ultimately lost 2-1.[4]  Both sides had Lancashire Cup ties on the same day; Bootle played theirs against Preston North End straight afterwards, while Law had to send a reserve team to Bolton Hornets, which also lost.[5]  The same season saw the biggest win credited to Law, a 6-0 victory at home to Southport;[6] soon afterwards captain Rylance moved to Southport and essentially took over the town\\'s club.[7]\\nThe last reference to a game being played by the club was a 2-2 draw with Blackburn Zingari in December 1882.[8]  For the 1882-83 season the club\\'s opponents were much lower key sides than in previous seasons, and the club lost to teams such as Cherry Tree F.C.[9] and Darwen Hibernians.[10]  The club had also gone out of the Lancashire Cup in the first round to Farnworth,[11] suggesting that, as some of the better players had moved to more high-profile clubs, there was no longer enough interest in a club with such a narrow constituency, and the club\\'s Football Association membership lapsed at the end of the 1882-83 season,[12] and was listed as having been a \"loss\" before the start of the next season.[13]\\nHarry Fecitt, FA Cup winner with Blackburn Rovers, played for the club in 1882[14]\\nJimmy Brown, winner of 3 FA Cup winners\\' medals with Rovers and future England international[15]\\nRalph Rylance, key figure in the history of Southport F.C. and inventor of the artificial football pitch[16]\\n\\nThis article about a defunct English football club is a stub.

Located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States, the station was licensed to Grinnell College Trustees of Iowa.[1] Live streaming was available through kdic.grinnell.edu and through the KDIC smartphone apps for iOS and Android.\\nKDIC had a one- to two-hour block format from 5PM-1AM every day. The DJs were mostly students as well as some members of the Grinnell community.\\nA select number of shows were podcasted and available at kdic.grinnell.edu.\\nOn December 6, 1948, KGRW began broadcasting as Grinnell College\\'s first radio station. It broadcast popular and classical music, news, and interviews. In 1961, students appealed for funding to upgrade the station equipment, but the request was turned down, and the station closed until spring 1968, when it was reopened as KDIC.[2]\\nKDIC went on the air on May 20, 1968 on 88.9\\xa0MHz using a 10-watt FM transmitter located on the second floor of Darby Gym. During the first year, eighty-five students provided enough staffing to allow for 121 hours a week of programming.\\nIn 1971, after experiencing increasing interference on 88.9\\xa0MHz, the FCC approved the frequency change to 88.5\\xa0MHz. In 1984, transmitter power was increased to 130 watts.[3]\\nThe licensee failed to file for license renewal by October 1, 2004 and the station\\'s license expired on February 1, 2005. The FCC approved a Special Temporary Authorization (STA) on October 18, 2005 and the station resumed operation, ceasing again on May 12, 2006 in anticipation of the end of the academic year. The FCC granted a second STA on September 22, 2006 and on January 31, 2007 approved the renewal of the KDIC license.[1]\\nThe FCC cancelled KDIC\\'s license again effective July 15, 2022, as the station had been silent since August 31, 2020.\\nAccording to campus legend, between the 1950s and 1970s, KGRW committed an FCC violation and was removed from the air for a year after station DJ\\'s illegally connected the radio transmitter to metal train tracks on campus, supposedly creating a transmission radius that was hundreds or possibly thousands of miles. According to FCC records, no such violation has ever been documented.[2][4][5][6]\\n\\nSarah Jory (born Sarah Elizabeth Jory; 20 November 1969 in Reading, Berkshire, England) is an English musician and vocalist.\\nSarah Jory began to learn to play musical instruments at the age of five, when she obtained her first steel guitar.[1]\\nIn 1978, she was backed by the group Poacher when she was featured on the BBC Radio 2\\'s Live from Golder\\'s.  Also at the age of nine, she joined the band Colorado Country after her father, Arthur Jory, secured her an audition. Jory played with the band for four years while completing her schooling. During this time, the band changed their name to Sarah and the Colorado Country.  Jory\\'s first album, Sarah\\'s Steel Line, which she recorded with the band Poacher, was released by Crow Records in 1980, when she was eleven years old.  After the album\\'s release, she was asked to play at the Peterborough Festival of Music, having appeared earlier at Neil Coppendale\\'s British Country Music Festival at the Brighton Centre.[2]\\nAt thirteen, Jory first visited the United States of America where she played at the Steel Guitar Convention in St. Louis with Buddy Emmons.[2]\\nFrom 1984 to 1992, Jory played thirteen steel guitar conventions in the US, appearing with Buddy Emmons, Lloyd Green and Paul Franklin and worked with Ricky Skaggs, Porter Wagoner and Gene Watson.[2]\\nIn 1985, the British Country Music Association voted Jory \"The Most Promising New Act\", followed by being voted the \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" for nine consecutive years by the BCMA. She also was voted \"European Country Rock Entertainer of the Year\". In 1995, 1996 and 1997, BCMA also voted her \"British Female Vocalist of the Year\".[2]\\nIn 1988, Jory worked in Bristol and formed her own professional band, opening for Eric Clapton in Dublin, among others and toured with Glen Campbell.[2]\\nJory played with the Van Morrison band during 2006 and 2009 and performed on his albums Keep It Simple and Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl and on the DVD Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl: The Concert Film.\\nIn 2009, she performed with the group Essence of Ireland.[2][3]\\nAppearances with other artists:\\nThe Heald House is a historic house at 19 West Street in Waterville, Maine.  Built in 1916 to a design by Herbert E. Knapp, it is the city\\'s only substantial example of Prairie School architecture.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.[1]\\nThe Heald House stands in a residential area west of downtown Waterville, at the southeast corner of West and Carroll Streets.  It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a hip roof, stuccoed walls, and a concrete foundation, and is scaled to fit in with the surrounding Colonial Revival and Queen Anne houses.  It exhibits a mix of Craftsman and Prairie School features, the latter including extended eaves, and the former its exposed rafters.

His parents are the artist Mary Bauermeister and the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen; the musician Markus Stockhausen is his half-brother.\\nBorn in Bergisch Gladbach, Stockhausen received his musical education from his father and various private teachers. He wrote his first compositions as a child and in 1980, he appeared publicly as a synthesizer player in the performance of his father\\'s composition Sternklang. In 1981, he performed as soprano saxophonist at the Teatro alla Scala in the opera Donnerstag aus Licht. After graduating from the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Schule Gymnasium Rösrath\\xa0[de] in 1986, Stockhausen gave concerts worldwide with his father\\'s ensemble and was involved in the production and composition of electronic music for two operas from the cycle Licht. In 1996 he ended the collaboration with his father.\\nSince 1982, he has also worked in various ensembles (including Kairos, Aparis and Possible Worlds) with his half-brother Markus Stockhausen. Together with Jo Thönes, they formed the jazz trio Aparis, which gave international concerts and published two CDs at ECM. In 1991, Simon and Markus together composed the piece Köln Music Fantasy for the fifth anniversary of the Kölner Philharmonie and in 1996, the piece Jubilee for the tenth anniversary. After the release of their album nonDuality in 2005 the musical paths of the half-brothers separated.[1]\\nSince 1991 Simon Stockhausen has been composing for various German ensembles in the field of contemporary music, including the Ensemble Modern and the MusikFabrik. This was followed by jazz compositions and performances as a keyboardist with Lalo Schifrin and James Morrison, among others, with whom he founded the band On the Edge in 2003.  Since 1998, he has composed numerous incidental music for plays, including for the Berliner Ensemble, the Schauspielhaus Dortmund, the Staatstheater Mainz, the Schauspiel Frankfurt, the Bad Hersfelder Festspiele, the Düsseldorfer and Kölner Schauspielhaus, as well as the Nationaltheater Mannheim (drama). He worked with directors such as Peter Palitzsch, Burkhard C. Kosminski and András Fricsay.\\nFor the Neuköllner Oper\\xa0[de], Simon Stockhausen composed the music theatre piece Rheingold Feuerland based on Wagner Das Rheingold to a libretto by Bernhard Glocks in 2011.[2]\\nIn 1999 he founded the group MIR with Manos Tsangaris – for whom he also realised various theatre music as co-composer – in which the Cologne percussionist Jaki Liebezeit was also involved. He has also performed in a wide variety of formations as a keyboardist, live electronic musician and soprano saxophonist, including with Vince Mendoza, Peter Erskine, Michael Riessler, Péter Eötvös, the WDR Big Band\\xa0[de], the Sharoun Ensemble and the Berliner Philharmoniker. In 2004, he founded the band Royce with Christian Weidner. Stockhausen also composed numerous soundtracks for feature films, documentaries and short films, including the cinema documentary Trip to Asia\\xa0[de] – Die Suche nach dem Einklang and feature films by Israeli film director Amos Gitai.\\nStockhausen and an ensemble of musicians put together for the 47th Grimme-Preis on 1 April 2011, designed the musical supporting programme for the award ceremony. For each of the 16 prizes awarded, Stockhausen composed his own music, which referred to the respective prize-winning films.[3]\\nIn the 2012/2013 concert season, Stockhausen was an artist in residence with the Hamburg Symphony and premiered a total of five new works, including a major orchestral piece entitled \"Doktrin der Ruhe\".[4]\\nSince 2016, Simon has also been working with his mother, the artist Mary Bauermeister, and composed, among other things, the work Farbrausch for the picture series Farbrausch, which was performed on various occasions.[5]\\nIn his compositional work, Simon Stockhausen makes use of the latest computer technology. He is particularly interested in the potential musicality of sounds and the exploration of sound in all its dimensions. Textures, rhythms and harmonies are derived from noises by sound synthesis and then processed in compositions. Through fundamental processes, e.g. time parameters, dynamic changes through compression and the possibility to play back recordings, recorded sounds are changed, i.e. processed. This approach can be described in musicological terms as \"compositional sound synthesis\".[6] He uses found sounds as material to create music in which the boundaries between pop, jazz, electronics and new music dissolve. The preparation of the material with the help of compositional sound synthesis has long been part of the composition process of a music that can detach language from its message and make sounds musical.\\n\\nThe Ulster Grand Prix is a motorcycle race that takes place on the 7.401\\xa0mi (11.911\\xa0km) Dundrod Circuit made up entirely of closed-off public roads near Belfast, Northern Ireland. The first races took place in 1922 and in 1935 and 1948 the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme gave it the title Grand Prix d\\'Europe. The Ulster Grand Prix was included as one of the races in the inaugural 1949 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season (now MotoGP), a place it held until 1971. It also counted for the Formula TT Championship between 1979 and 1990.[citation needed] According to the race organisers, it is the fastest road race in the world.[1]\\n[2] The race has been held on three different circuits. The 20.5\\xa0mi (33.0\\xa0km) Old Clady circuit was used from 1922 until 1939 and included a notoriously bumpy 7\\xa0mi (11\\xa0km) straight.[2]\\nAfter World War II the new Clady circuit was used that, due to road improvements, was now 16.467\\xa0mi (26.501\\xa0km) in length and in use between 1947 and 1952.\\nIn 1953 the race was moved to the 7.401\\xa0mi (11.911\\xa0km) Dundrod Circuit where it is still held. The 1971 event was won by Australian Jack Findlay in what was the Ulster Grand Prix\\'s last year as part of the FIM Grand Prix international motorcycle racing calendar. Findlay\\'s victory on a Suzuki was also notable for marking the first 500cc class win for a motorcycle powered by a two stroke engine.[3][4] The event was cancelled in 1972 because of the political situation in Northern Ireland, but it was held in 2001 during the Foot-and-mouth crisis, even though the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT were cancelled that year.[5][6]\\nIn 1997 Dublin sidecar pilot Stephen Galligan died of injuries sustained in a warm-up crash the day before the race.

It has the appearance of a ship with a bow cutting through the waves. The house was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1948 and completed in 1951 for Mrs. Clinton Della Walker of Pebble Beach. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\\nThe house, an example of Wright\\'s organic architecture, is built on granite boulders, uses the local Carmel-stone, and has a roof the color of the sea that is shaped to resemble the bow of a ship. It is the only Frank Lloyd Wright house that overlooks the ocean. Mrs. Clinton Walker told Wright she wanted a house “as durable as the rocks and as transparent as the waves.\" The house has a view of the Carmel Bay and Pebble Beach.[3][4][5]\\nMrs. Clinton Walker House was built by Miles Bain.[2] It has a Usonian design; it is a small (originally only 1,200 square feet), single-story house that incorporates a hexagon floor with 120-degree angles, with three rooms completely open with views of the ocean. The low roof is covered with copper shingles. The living-dining room is centered around a floor-to-ceiling fireplace with built-in furniture. The hexagonal modules of the floor plan gave the appearance of a honeycomb. The window frames are painted in Wright\\'s signature \"Cherokee Red\" color with reverse-stepped glass windows. A master bedroom was added in 1956. The house is similar to the Hanna House in Palo Alto.[3][4]\\nIn 1954, Wright said, \"The over-all-effect is quiet, and the long white surf lines of the sea seem to join the lines of the house to make a natural melody.\" The California Style landscape design was achieved by  Thomas D.

The expansive fortress was constructed over ten centuries by different rulers\\nThe fortress is in the shape of an irregular polygon, it is 117 meters wide and 175 meters long. It is mainly protected by its large walls, which are 10 meters high and 1.6 to 3 meters thick. Along the walls there are approximately 14 towers, most are around 12 meters high. The towers are not uniform, there are both round and rectangular towers, and some more irregular ones too. Two gates and five secret entrances lead to the inside of the fortress.\\nThe Roman walls of the fortress were built with the Roman technique \"opus mixtum\". They were erected using both stone and brick, while powdered brick mortar was used to bind them together.[1]\\nThe fortress has been destroyed three times - first by the Huns,  who destroyed it sometime before the rule of Justinian I, who is recorded as restoring it, and a second time about 598-599 AD, when it was destroyed by a group of Avars and Slavs, and finally by forces of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th Century, after this attack the fortress was not repaired, leaving it in its current state.[2]\\nBulgarians repaired the fortress extensively in the 6th century after it was destroyed by the Avars and Slavs. The region of Sliven, in \\nwhich the fortress lies, was integrated into the First Bulgarian Empire around 705 AD, as part of the new Zagora region, which was populated mainly by Slavs and had been given to the Khan of Bulgaria, Tervel according to his contract with the Byzantine emperor Justinian II.\\nIt remained in use during the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, serving as in important stronghold in the region.[3]\\nIn the 15th Century, forces of the Ottoman Empire partially destroyed and captured the fortress, marking the end of the fortress\\' use.[4]\\nCoordinates: .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}42°16′33″N 22°41′29″E\\ufeff / \\ufeff42.2758°N 22.6914°E\\ufeff / 42.2758; 22.6914\\nNicola da Guardiagrele (born Nicola Gallucci or Nicola di Andrea di Pasquale; c. 1385/1390[1] – c. 1462) was an Italian late medieval goldsmith, painter and etcher.\\nBorn at Guardiagrele, in what is now the province of Chieti, he was primarily influenced by Gothic art and by the contemporary Tuscan school of artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti.\\nHe worked mostly as goldsmith, with numerous works dated and signed, although also sculptures and a panel painting are also attributed to him.

Packard co-founded, in 1877, the Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society, supporting missionary women bringing education to the African-American and Native American communities.[1]\\nThe Woman\\'s Baptist Home Mission Society (WBHMS) was founded in Chicago in 1877 to \"promote the Christianization of homes by means of missions and mission schools, with special reference to the freed people, the Indians and immigrant heathen populations.\" In five years there were 22 workers in seven southern states. Moore was the first commissioned missionary. The WBHMS would later found the Baptist Missionary Training School in Chicago, send teachers to the Missionary Training Department of Shaw in Raleigh, North Carolina, and begin new work with the Piute Indians in Nevada and Mono Indians in California. The WBHMS founded the orphanage at Kodiak, Alaska, in 1893.\\nOn November 14, 1877, over two hundred ladies from Boston and vicinity met in the Meionaon, Tremont Temple, Boston for the purpose of organizing a woman\\'s home mission society.Sophia B. Packard  presided. Much encouragement was given by a woman from Maine, who said that the women of her state were ready and waiting to unite with such a society. A constitution was adopted, and officers chosen. The name given was \"Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society\" (WABHMS). Its objects were, \"The evangelization of the women among the freed-people, the Indians, the heathen immigrants, and the new settlements of the West.\" Laurana B. Banvard was made President; Mrs. A. J. Loud, Vice President; Mrs. Thomas Nickerson, Corresponding Secretary; Sophia B. Packard, Treasurer. An executive committee of twelve was also chosen. Mrs. A. P. Mason, and Mrs. A. Pollard were appointed to prepare a paper for the churches, in the interest of the Society. Later, this committee presented a paper entitled \"An appeal from the Woman\\'s Baptist Home Mission to the Women of New England\". Three thousand of these appeals were printed and circulated, and were also sent to editors of Baptist denominational papers throughout New England. Dr. A. P. Mason also prepared a leaflet showing the need of a Woman\\'s Home Mission Society, and 10,000 of these were circulated. [2]\\nThe first Circle, auxiliary to the Society, was formed at Jamaica Plain; and the first money (US$50), was sent in March, 1878, to aid Harriet Newell Hart in her work among the African American people in a little village in Georgia. In March, a committee was appointed to secure an act of incorporation. On May 20, 1878, the Society was legally incorporated as the \"Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society\". On May 24, Mrs. Thomas Nickerson, who had just returned from the south and west, met the Board of Directors, and urged the need of pushing forward the Home Mission work. In June of this year, Dr. Cutting, Corresponding Secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, met the women of the Board and talked with them of the Home field, and its urgent need of woman\\'s work. In August, Mrs. Banvard was appointed to prepare a paper for circulation among churches and associations. A public meeting of the Society was held September 18th, in the vestry of Tremont Temple. In September, Packard was elected Corresponding Secretary in place of Mrs. Nickerson, whose health compelled her resignation; and Mrs. Pollard was made Treasurer in place of Miss Packard. The first public meeting outside of Boston, was in September, in connection with the State Convention, at Hyannis, Massachusetts. The First Annual Meeting was at the Clarendon Street Church, Boston, November 14, 1878; five teachers were reported in their fields of labor, two were under appointment, and the receipts of the year totaled US$1,533.[2]\\nIn 1880, the society sent Packard on a trip to assess the living conditions of black people in the South. She visited homes, schools, and churches in Richmond, Nashville, and New Orleans. She returned to Boston to report the bleak findings of her Southern pilgrimage and proposed a school for women and girls. The society was unwilling to support the idea of a new school, reasoning that the South was too hostile, they did not have the funds, and that Packard (age 56) and Giles (age 48) were too old. Packard sold personal possessions to raise money and planned a school in Atlanta near Morehouse College, supported by the American Baptist Home Mission Society. The Women\\'s Society reversed its original decision and, in March 1881, commissioned Packard and Giles as missionaries and teachers to begin a school in Atlanta.\\nOn April 11, 1881, in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta, the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary (now, Spelman College)[3] opened with 11 students. Within three months, enrollment had grown to 80 and additional teachers were sent by the Women\\'s Society. The ABHMS provided a down payment for a new campus, but pressure was exerted by the ABHMS to merge the men\\'s school with the women\\'s school to create a co-education seminary. The women resisted and, in 1882, had an opportunity to meet with John D. Rockefeller at the Wilson Avenue Baptist Church in Cleveland. Laura Spelman Rockefeller and her sister Lucy had been students at Oread, 1858–1859, and had met Packard and Giles on a visit in 1864. Packard\\'s vision for the future of the school, financial astuteness, and missionary piety secured assistance from Rockefeller. Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller visited the school in 1884 on the school\\'s third anniversary. The debt on a new campus with five frame buildings, formerly used as a barracks for the Union Army occupying Atlanta, was discharged, and the school was renamed Spelman Seminary for Women and Girls in honor of Laura Rockefeller\\'s parents. Packard was treasurer and president of Spelman Seminary from its charter in 1888 until her death in 1891. There were 464 students and 34 faculty at the time of her death.\\nIn 1891, Alice Blanchard Coleman became president of the Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society and held that position until April, 1911, when, by the consolidation of the Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society, headquarters in Boston, and the Woman\\'s Baptist Home Mission Society, headquarters in Chicago, a new national organization was formed having the name of the Boston organization but with headquarters in Chicago. Coleman was the first vice-president of the new organization and president of the New England Branch of the Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society, the branch being a local organization whose purpose was the holding of inspirational meetings and otherwise fostering the work of the Woman\\'s American Baptist Home Mission Society.[4]\\nIn 1955, the WABHMS merged with the American Baptist Home Mission Society of the American Baptist Churches USA.[5]\\nGeneral Artur Ivens Ferraz (Portuguese pronunciation:\\xa0[ɐɾˈtuɾ ˈajvɐ̃ʃ fɨˈʁaʃ]; 1 December 1870, in Lisbon – 16 January 1933, in Lisbon), was a Portuguese military officer and politician. He served in the Portuguese Expeditionary Force during the Portuguese participation in World War I, in France. He was later Governor-General of Portuguese Mozambique, and was Minister of Trade, Colonies and Finances. He also served as Prime Minister from 8 July 1929 to 21 January 1930. He later occupied the post of general administrator of the Army and head of the Armed Forces.\\nBorn in Lisbon in 1870, he was the son of engineer Ricardo Júlio Ferraz and his wife Catherine Prescott Hickling Ivens. He had five brothers and one sister; three of his brothers also went into the military.\\nHe was educated at the Royal Military College from 1883 to 1888. He then attended the Escola Politécnica in Lisbon and the School of the Army, where he completed the Artillery course with a high mark in 1893.[1]\\nIn 1900, he completed the Army Staff course with distinction. While still a lieutenant, he headed the Portuguese mission that witnessed the British army manoeuvres in 1904. Between 1904 and 1918, he was a professor at the School of the Army, where he taught artillery tactics. He also taught English at the Military College from 1905 to 1913.[2]\\nIn the First World War, Ivens Ferraz was appointed chief liaison officer of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (CEP) with the British army in France in 1917. Previously, he headed a military mission to the War Office at the outbreak of the war (1914) and held other senior positions in the CEP.

After school Vladislav Kirpichev tried to do the aerospace faculty (faculty of space technology \"Motors, appliances and machines)\" in South-Ural State University, but did not get the right number of points and left for another specialty. Later, he decided to enter the Institute of Architecture in Moscow.\\n1969 - Vladislav Kirpichev became a student at the Moscow Architectural Institute . In parallel, he became interested in classical ballet, choreography studio engaged in the Bolshoi Theater, and even at some point going to enter the GITIS (National Institute of Dramatic Art). But in the third year Kirpichev met his future mentor Lezhava Ilya, who was recruiting a talented group of third-year students for the next year . Then Vladislav took a sabbatical and spent several months in Moscow libraries, where he studied the monograph, architectural journals, so he entered the desired course.\\n1972 - When he was in the group Lezhava, won the competition of the International Union of Architects in Paris and received a UNESCO award.\\n1975 - after graduation the Moscow Architectural Institute, a young architect distribution ranked Mosproekt 1 and until 1977 was in the public service, where was an atmosphere of conservatism and denial of the \"complex architecture\".[1] Two years later he left Mosproject and created his own studio, joining a group of like-minded to practice \"informal architecture\".\\n1978 - the studio was called EDAS - Experimental Children Architectural Studio (children themselves invented this name). Very quickly the idea was born to bring to designing teenagers. First, in the studio was just 5 pupils aged 14–15 years, and it was called \" First studio .\" But a year later the number wishing increased. Over the years, the age of visitors to the Studio declined: at first in the Studio took no children under the age of 5–6 years, now the youngest of students is  2.5 years old. At the time of suspension of activity of the Studio in 1997, it was simultaneously engaged in 120 children. By this time the Studio EDAS became well known in the world, and the name of Vladislav Kirpichev - very authoritative.[2]\\n1984 - applied for a Rolan Bykov’s  course  at the Higher Courses for Scriptwriters and directors.\\n1993 - Vladislav Kirpichev was at first time invited as a guest professor for architectural faculty at FH Frankfurt / Main (Technical University).

It is competitive with the chloride process and the sulfate process, which achieve similar net conversions.[1][2]\\nWith the idealized formula FeTiO3, ilmenite contains 55-65% titanium dioxide, the rest being iron oxide. The Becher process, like other beneficiation processes, aims to remove iron.  The Becher process exploits the conversion of the ferrous iron (FeO) to ferric iron (Fe2O3).[3]\\nThis technology was developed in the early 1960s in Western Australia[4] by a joint initiative between industry and government. The process was named after Robert Gordon Becher, who while working at the Western Australian Government Chemical Laboratories (the precursor to ChemCentre) invented, developed and introduced the technique to the Western Australian Mineral Sands industry.[5] The process was patented in 1961.[6]\\nThe Becher process is suitable for weathered ilmenite that has low concentrations of chromium and magnesium.[7] There are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmenite:\\nOxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert iron to iron(III) oxide:\\nThis step is suitable for a range of ilmenite-containing feedstocks.[8]\\nReduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (Fe2O3.TiO2), coal, and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200\\xa0°C.[9] The iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite:\\nThe \"reduced ilmenite\" is separated from the char prior to the next step.\\nAeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by \"rusting\" it out. This conversion is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% ammonium chloride solution with air being pumped through the tank. The tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate in the form of a slime.\\nThe finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile.\\nOnce the majority of the iron oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5M sulfuric acid.[10]\\n\\nLawrence Joseph \"Larry\"  Dwyer (2 February 1884 – August 1964) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative fullback who captained the Wallabies in 1913.\\nDwyer, a fullback, was born in Orange, New South Wales. He was schooled at the Patrician Brothers School in Orange but left school at age 12 and worked as a clerk in a solicitor\\'s office while playing rugby for the Orange Waratahs club.[2]\\nDwyer first came to public notice playing for a Western Districts representative side of country New South Wales in 1908. He made his New South Wales representative debut in 1910 appearing in two games against a touring All Blacks side playing alongside other future Wallaby captains in Sydney Middleton, Ward Prentice, Ted Fahey and Fred Wood.[2] His performances in those matches saw him picked to make his international debut for Australia in a Test match against those same touring New Zealand All Blacks in Sydney on 25 June 1910. He was picked for all three Test matches of the tour and gave an outstanding defensive performance in the 2nd Test which Australian won 11–0.[3] He made further state appearances for New South Wales that year and was selected in a Central-Western representative side which met a touring American Universities team.\\nHe was selected in the Wallabies squad for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the USA.[4] The tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two California University sides and three Canadian provincial sides. In 1913 he was picked at captain for New South Wales and for Western Districts in matches against the visiting New Zealand national side.\\nThe pinnacle of Dwyer\\'s representative career was in 1913 when he was selected to captain the 1913 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand on a tour of New Zealand. He played in three tour matches before being injured and consequently missed the first two Tests of the tour. He was back for two more tour games and the third Test which Australia won 16–5. He made three further Test appearances in 1914 when New Zealand toured Australia at the outbreak of World War I.\\nDwyer played thirty-one times for New South Wales in a ten-year career that continued until he was thirty-five. He claimed a career total of twenty-four appearances for Australia, six as captain. Eight of those games were international Test caps, one as captain.\\nRichard Walker Barton (July 3, 1799 – January 15, 1860) was a nineteenth-century politician, lawyer and planter from Virginia.[1][2] His nephew Robert Thomas Barton (1842-1917), who unlike three of his brothers survived fighting in the Confederate States Army, also became a distinguished lawyer in the Winchester, Virginia area, as well as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and author. Career U.S. Army officer turned controversial Confederate engineer Seth Maxwell Barton of Fredericksburg was a more distant relative.\\nBorn at \"Shady Oak\" farm about six miles from Winchester, Virginia, to the former Martha Walker and her husband Richard Peters Barton. His grandfather was Rev. Thomas Barton. When Richard was a young boy, his father bought 288 acres of land on Opequon Creek that included a stone house that local pioneer John Hite had built in 1753. The Bartons renamed the property \"Springdale\" and this man lived there as an adult and conveyed it to one of his brothers in his will. The area comprising both farms was later known as \"Bartonsville.\" R.W. Barton had four brothers and three sisters. He received a private education appropriate to his class, then studied law.[1]\\nBarton married twice. His first wife, the former Alcinda Gibson of nearby Culpeper County, bore two sons and a daughter before her death in 1829. Barton remarried, to Caroline Marx, who bore two sons and two daughters.[1]\\nAdmitted to the Virginia bar, Barton began his law practice in Winchester, the Frederick county seat. He also farmed using enslaved labor, and Winchester was also the site of the chancery court for northwestern Virginia, which handled cases involving decedents\\' estates and matters involving women and slaves who had no status in the civil court system. In 1830 Barton owned 24 slaves, including 9 boys and a girl under 10 years of age, and one enslaved man older than 55.[3] By 1840, he owned 30 slaves and by 1859 his real estate was worth more than $100,000.[1] However, the slave schedules first instituted in the 1850 census show him as owning 28 slaves, ranging from a 100 year old man to 11 children 10 and under.[4] Barton enlarged Springdale to about 610 acres, and also speculated in land in Frederick county and westward in Randolph County that became part of the new state of West Virginia not long after his death. He helped found the Valley Agricultural Society of Frederick County, which began holding an annual cattle show in 1856.[1]\\nFrederick County voters first elected Barton to represent them, part time, in the Virginia General Assembly in April 1823, and he was not immediately re-elected after his first term. Following the adoption of the new Virginia Constitution, Frederick County was allowed to select three delegates to that body, and Barton not only won election in 1832, but won re-election the following year with the most votes of all the candidates, and was the second-highest vote-getter in 1834. He won election to the House of Delegates for the last time in 1838. serving for most of 1839.[5]\\nBarton ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as the candidate of the new Whig party in 1839, but lost to Democrat William Lucas. Two years later, in 1840, he defeated Lucas and served as Congressman from Virginia\\'s 15th congressional district from 1841 to 1843. He did not seek reelection following the redistricting in 1842, which pushed the 15th district further westward, and put Frederick County in Virginia\\'s 10th congressional district, which re-elected William Lucas. Barton resumed his legal practice in Winchester and other investments.[1]\\nThe day following his execution of a last will and testament, Barton died on his estate called \"Springdale\" near Winchester on March 15, 1859. He was interred in the family cemetery on the estate.[1]\\n\\n\\nThis article about a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia is a stub.

Concerned that Etzel would end up in less humane hands, he declined larger offers and instead sent the dog to a friend who operated a reputable kennel in White Plains, New York.[3] At age three, Etzel was brought to the United States to be sold.[4]\\nAt the sixth annual show of the Shepherd Dog Club of America, October 15–16, 1920, Etzel placed third in his class. He was described as \"immense in body and hind leg formation, in body and legs a trifle better than either of the dogs above him\".[5]\\nEtzel was seen by film director Laurence Trimble, who had owned and guided Jean, the Vitagraph Dog, the first canine movie star in the United States. Trimble recognized Etzel\\'s potential and persuaded Jane Murfin, a screenwriter for his films, to buy the dog.[3][4] A new name, Strongheart, was suggested by the publicity department of First National Pictures, which released his first film.[6]\\nTrimble trained Strongheart and directed him in four rugged outdoor adventure films scripted by Murfin: The Silent Call (1921), Brawn of the North (1922), The Love Master (1924) and White Fang (1925).[7] Strongheart became the first major canine film star,[8] preceding the fame of Rin Tin Tin by two years.[9]\\nStrongheart\\'s films did much to encourage the popularity of the German Shepherd breed. Strongheart and his mate, Lady Jule, had many offspring and their line survives to this day.[citation needed]\\nIn 1929, while being filmed for a movie, Strongheart accidentally made contact with a hot studio light and was burned. These burns caused a tumor to form, which ultimately caused his death.[10]\\nStrongheart died June 24, 1929, at Murfin\\'s home.[2]\\nVirtually all of Strongheart\\'s films have been lost.[12]:\\u200a61\\u200a A print of The Love Master (1924) survives in France, at the National Center of Cinematography and the moving image.[13] The Return of Boston Blackie (1927) survives from a 16mm print[14][15] and is available on region-free DVD.[16]\\nStrongheart was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. His star is located at 1724\\xa0Vine Street.[17]\\nIn the 1926 picture book Strongheart; The Story of a Wonder Dog, Trimble wrote the story of how Strongheart came to the United States and was chosen for motion pictures, of his training, and of his progress in films culminating with White Fang.[3]\\nStrongheart\\'s popularity inspired Doyle Packing Company to adopt his name and photograph for a canned dog food in 1932.[18][19] Strongheart Dog Food did a respectable business, especially in the Midwest,[20] and was available in stores until at least 2002.[21]\\nJ. Allen Boone wrote two books, Letters to Strongheart (1939)[22] and Kinship with All Life (1954),[23] about animal communication and the survival of the dog\\'s soul after death. Both books were reprinted many times and remain classics of the Spiritualist faith. Boone was a Washington Post correspondent who looked after Strongheart for an extended period while Murfin and Trimble were away on business. Boone and Strongheart reportedly formed a deep bond, and Boone believed the dog was a transformational being.[12]:\\u200a62–63\\u200a\\nStrongheart: The World’s First Movie Star Dog (2014) is a picture book for young audiences by Caldecott Medal winner Emily Arnold McCully.[24] The New York Times praised her \"meticulous job of recreating the quicksilver world of that bygone media age. The megaphones, bobbed hair and jodhpurs are all here. And in Etzel, a dog born and bred to be strong and brave, she has given young readers a rare portrait of a Hollywood hero who was just as heroic off-screen as on.\"[25]\\nStrongheart: Wonder Dog of the Silver Screen (2018) is a novel for ages 8–12 by Candace Fleming and illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner Eric Rohmann.[26] Kirkus Reviews said, \"Like a silent movie plot, Fleming’s narrative is full of adventure, romance, and suspense.\"[27] The book received a starred review in Booklist.[28]\\n\\nCotycuara albomarginata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The national team is controlled by the Swedish Basketball Federation.\\nSweden has qualified for the EuroBasket ten times throughout their history. Their best tournament result was the 11th place finish at the 1995 edition. The Scandinavian squad has also qualified for the Olympic Games once, in 1980, finishing in 10th place. However, Sweden still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the FIBA World Cup.\\nSweden\\'s European Basketball Championship debut came at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. Although the Swedes did not fare well in their first tournament appearance. As they lost all seven of their matches to finish in last place in the 17 team tournament.\\nSweden\\'s second appearance on the continental level came at EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. The team got off to an demoralizing start by losing to Switzerland in their first match. Although Sweden would achieve their first ever win at the EuroBasket against Luxembourg in their second match of the preliminary phase. However, they followed it by losing their next two matches in the round as well to Romania, and the Soviet Union. They finished 4th out of the 5 teams in the group with an (1-3) record, and found themselves in the classification rounds. There, the team once again finished with an (1-3) record in their pool, with their only victory coming against Denmark. Two losses in the classification 13th–16th place semifinals and the 15th/16th place final (a rematch against Luxembourg) put Sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams.    \\nSweden qualified for the EuroBasket eight more times with their three best finishes coming in 1969, 1983 and 1995. They also made their lone Summer Olympics appearance in 1980. But overall the national team has struggled to reach an elite level of consistency to become a serious medal contender at major international tournaments. At some events, however, the team displayed potential. E.g. at the EuroBasket 2013 they beat the heavily favored former champion Russia 81-62.    \\n\\n.mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}\\xa0\\xa0Win\\n\\xa0\\xa0Loss\\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA World Cup Qualifiers matches on 30 June and 3 July 2022 against Finland and Slovenia.[3]\\n1953 EuroBasket: finished 17th among 17 teams\\n3 Rune Erkers, 4 Kjell Eliasson, 5 Sture Herrman, 6 Staffan Widén, 7 Bo Widén, 8 Örjan Widén, 9 Åke Larsson, 10 Lars Olsson, 11 Erik Sundell, 12 Bengt Gustafsson, 13 Lars-Erik Keijser, 14 Per-Åke Hallberg (Coach: Lars-Åke Nilsson)\\n1955 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 18 teams\\n3 Staffan Widén, 4 Bo Widén, 5 Örjan Widén, 6 Jan Holmberg, 7 Alvin Tornblom, 8 Lars Helgostam, 9 Sture Herrman, 10 Per-Åke Hallberg, 11 Palle Cardell, 12 Bengt Gustafsson, 13 Jan Oldenmark, 14 Anders Renner, 15 Gustaf Ragge, 16 Nils af Trolle (Coach: Lars-Åke Nilsson)\\n1961 EuroBasket: finished 18th among 19 teams\\n4 Svante af Klinteberg, 5 Staffan Widén, 6 Udo Tohver, 7 Bo Widén, 8 Torbjörn Langemar, 9 Alvin Törnblom, 10 Bjorn Lundberg, 11 Lars Andersson, 12 Curt Wennström, 13 Örjan Widén, 14 Gunars Kraulis, 15 Lennart Dahllöf (Coach: Juris Reneslacis)\\n1965 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\\n4 Hans Albertsson, 5 Jörgen Hansson, 6 Anders Grönlund, 7 Rune Leinas, 8 Per-Olof Svensson, 9 Ulf Lindelöf, 10 Björn Lundberg, 11 Torbjörn Langemar, 12 Lars Cullert, 13 Per-Olof Lefwerth, 14 Kaj Håkansson, 15 Egon Håkanson (Coach: Rolf Nygren)\\n1969 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 12 teams\\n4 Kjell Gunna, 5 Bo Lundmark, 6 Anders Grönlund, 7 Ulf Lindelöf, 8 Arturs Veigurs, 9 Ebbe Edström, 10 Janos Fugedi, 11 Jan Hjorth, 12 Per-Olof Lefwerth, 13 Kjell Rannelid, 14 Hans Albertsson, 15 Jörgen Hansson (Coach: Arne Jansson)\\n1980 Olympic Games: finished 10th among 12 teams\\n4 Peter Andersson, 5 Thomas Nordgren, 6 Peter Gunterberg, 7 Göran Unger, 8 Torbjörn Taxén, 9 Joon-Olof \"Jonte\" Karlsson, 10 Jan Enjebo, 11 Bernt Malion, 12 Roland Rahm, 13 Sten Feldreich, 14 Leif Yttergren, 15 Åke Skyttevall (Coach: Mike Perry)\\n1983 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 12 teams\\n4 Bill Magarity, 5 Bernt Malion, 6 Peter Nyström, 7 Jerry Sehlberg, 8 Thomas Nordgren, 9 Joon-Olof \"Jonte\" Karlsson, 10 Kenny Grant, 11 Bo Faleström, 12 Roland Rahm, 13 Sten Feldreich, 14 Göran Eriksson, 15 Åke Skyttevall (Coach: Sven Jensen)\\n1993 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 16 teams\\n4 Olle Håkanson, 5 Magnus Tegel, 6 Örjan Andersson, 7 Henrik Evers, 8 Henrik Gaddefors, 9 Peter Borg, 10 Martin Jansson, 11 Jens Tillman, 12 Torbjörn Gehrke, 13 Anders Marcus, 14 Per Stümer, 15 Mattias Sahlström (Coach: Rolf Nilsson)\\n1995 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 14 teams\\n4 Olle Håkanson, 5 Örjan Andersson, 6 Christian Larsson, 7 Henrik Evers, 8 Henrik Gaddefors, 9 Jonas Larsson, 10 Oscar Lefwerth, 11 Joakim Blom, 12 Torbjörn Gehrke, 13 Anders Marcus, 14 Vincent Lundahl, 15 Mattias Sahlström (Coach: Rolf Nilsson)\\n2003 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\\n4 Paul Burke, 5 Hakan Larsson, 6 Jens Stalhandske, 7 Mats Levin, 8 Oluoma Nnamaka, 9 Jonas Larsson, 10 Lesli Myrthil, 11 Joakim Blom, 12 Fredrik Jonzen, 13 Christian Maråker, 14 John Pettersson, 15 Daniel Dajic (Coach: Jan Enjebo)\\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 24 teams\\n4 Ludvig Håkanson, 5 Jonathan Skjöldebrand, 6 Joakim Kjellbom, 7 Dino Pita, 8 Anton Gaddefors, 9 Brice Massamba, 10 Kenny Grant, 11 Jonas Jerebko, 12 Thomas Massamba, 13 Erik Rush, 14 Jeffery Taylor, 15 Viktor Gaddefors (Coach: Brad Dean)\\nThe Rochester Contemporary Art Center is a non-profit art center located in Rochester, New York\\'s East End District.

He played 14 years as a quarterback in the NFL, with Chicago from 1987 to 1993, the Indianapolis Colts from 1994 to 1997, the Baltimore Ravens in 1998,  and the San Diego Chargers in 1999 to 2000. He first became a regular starting quarterback in 1990 with Chicago. In 1995 with Indianapolis, he led the Colts to the AFC Championship Game, was selected to the Pro Bowl and was honored as NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\\nFrom 1994 to 2001, while still playing in the NFL, Harbaugh was an unpaid assistant coach at Western Kentucky University, where his father Jack was head coach. In 2002, he returned to the NFL as the quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders. Harbaugh returned to the college ranks in 2004 as the head coach at the University of San Diego. After leading San Diego to consecutive Pioneer League championships in 2005 and 2006, he moved to Stanford in 2007, where he led the Cardinal to two bowl berths in four seasons, including a win in the 2011 Orange Bowl. Immediately afterward, Harbaugh signed a five-year deal as head coach of the NFL\\'s San Francisco 49ers, where he led the team to the NFC Championship game in each of his first three seasons after the franchise missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons beforehand. He and his older brother, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh, became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history. Their teams played in a Thanksgiving Classic game in 2011 and in Super Bowl XLVII at the end of the 2012 season.\\nBorn in Toledo, Ohio on December 23, 1963, Harbaugh is the son of Jacqueline M. \"Jackie\" (née Cipiti) and Jack Harbaugh.[3] His mother is of half-Sicilian and half-Polish ancestry and his father is of Irish and German ancestry.[4] Both Jim and his brother John were born in Toledo, while his father was an assistant football coach at nearby Perrysburg High School in Perrysburg.\\nDuring Harbaugh\\'s childhood, the family moved frequently, as his father held assistant coaching positions at Morehead State (1967), Bowling Green (1967–1970), Iowa (1971–1973), Michigan (1973–1979), Stanford (1980–1981), and Western Michigan (1982–1986). Harbaugh played for the junior league Ann Arbor Packers and then for Tappan Junior High before moving on to Pioneer High School.  When his father became defensive coordinator at Stanford, he transferred to Palo Alto High School, graduating in 1982.[5][6]\\nIn February 1982, Harbaugh committed to play football for Bo Schembechler\\'s Michigan Wolverines football team.[7] He came to Michigan with a \"high school reputation as a slick California passer.\"[8]\\nAs a true freshman in 1982, Harbaugh, at age 18, and junior Dave Hall were backups to quarterback Steve Smith, who had broken Michigan\\'s single season record with 2,335 yards of total offense in 1981.[9] In the 1982 season, Smith started all 12 games, and Hall handled the limited backup role.[10][11] Even as Smith struggled, coach Schembechler expressed a reluctance to play Harbaugh, saying, \"To suddenly pull some freshman out of the bag, I don\\'t think you can do that in today\\'s football.\"[12] Harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the NCAA\\'s redshirt rule.[10][13]\\nHarbaugh performed well in the annual spring game in April 1983, completing 10 of 15 passes for 116 yards. After the game, coach Schembechler noted, \"Harbaugh is a fresh talent who\\'ll be all right, but he has a lot to learn.\"[14] While Harbaugh was touted as the team\\'s \"pass-oriented quarterback of the future,\"[13] he spent the 1983 season as Michigan\\'s No. 3 quarterback behind Steve Smith and Dave Hall.  Smith started 11 games, and Hall started one game, while Harbaugh completed two of five passes for 40 yards in limited action.[15][16] Harbaugh completed his first pass for Michigan on November 5, 1983, in a 42–10 victory over Purdue.\\nIn the spring of 1984, Harbaugh was in a three-way competition for Michigan\\'s starting quarterback job.  Three-year starter Steve Smith had graduated, and his backup, Dave Hall, was lost to a knee injury. The 1983 competition pitted Harbaugh against sophomores Chris Zurbrugg and Russ Rein.[17] In April 1984, Schembechler said, \"Harbaugh is coming along pretty well. He\\'s having a pretty good spring. Zurbrugg has emerged as a good prospect. There\\'s kind of a battle in there.\"[18] In the 1984 spring game, Harbaugh impressed observers as he completed 17 of 26 passes for 161 yards and an interception. Schembechler said after the game, \"We\\'ve been happy with Jim all spring. He\\'s shown a lot of maturity.\"[19] After spring practice, Schembechler announced his depth chart with Harbaugh as his No. 1 quarterback.[20]\\nIn his first collegiate start, Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 22–14 upset victory over a Miami Hurricanes team that was led by Bernie Kosar, had won the 1983 national championship, and was ranked No. 1 in both the AP and UPI polls. Harbaugh completed 11 of 21 passes for 162 yards and two interceptions.[21] The Detroit Free Press praised Harbaugh for \"pinpoint passing\" that \"kept Miami\\'s defense on the run.\"[22]\\nIn his second start, the Wolverines (ranked No. 3) lost to a Washington team that finished the season ranked No. 2 in both the AP and UPI polls.  Harbaugh threw a career-high 37 passes in the game, completing 17 passes for 183 yards, three interceptions, and his first collegiate touchdown pass to Vince Bean.[23]\\nAfter the loss to Washington, Harbaugh led Michigan to victories over Wisconsin (20–14) and Indiana (14–6). Harbaugh completed 25 of 39 passes for 272 yards in those games. On October 6, 1984, a 19–7 loss to Michigan State in the fifth game of the season, Harbaugh sustained a badly broken left arm in the third quarter when he dove for a loose ball and collided with Spartan linebacker Thomas Tyree.  Harbaugh had to be carried from the field on a stretcher and missed the remainder of the season.[24][25] Harbaugh completed 60 of 111 passes for 718 yards, three touchdowns and five interceptions during his shortened 1984 season.[26]\\nBy April 1985, Harbaugh\\'s arm had healed, and he completed 10 of 16 passes for 146 yards in the annual spring game.[27] Harbaugh was the starting quarterback in all 12 games for the 1985 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10–1–1 record, outscored opponents 342–98, defeated Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 2 in the final AP and UPI polls.[28]\\nOn October 26, 1985, Harbaugh set a school record with 283 passing yards in a 42–15 victory over Indiana.[29]  After the game, Harbaugh was asked for his reaction to setting the school\\'s passing record and responded, \"Records are nice, but everything we do here is team oriented. Everyone\\'s telling me about the record, but they should tell it to Paul Jokisch and Eric Kattus and John Kolesar.  They caught the passes.\"[29]\\nOn November 16, 1985, in a 48–7 victory over Minnesota, Harbaugh completed 13 of 18 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns. After the game, Harbaugh praised the offensive line, noting, \"I\\'ve never had more time to throw in my life—junior high, high school.\"[30]  Harbaugh\\'s 13 completions against Minnesota gave him 123 for the season, breaking the school record of 118 set by Steve Smith in 1982.[31]\\nOn November 23, 1985, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 27–17 victory over Ohio State. In the fourth quarter, Harbaugh completed a 77-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Kolesar, giving Michigan a 10-point lead with nine minutes remaining.  Coach Schembechler said after the game that the 77-yard touchdown was \"a play that took the starch right out of their sails.\"[32] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote after the game that Harbaugh\\'s pass to Kolesar was an image that would last: \"The image that repeats will be that of Jim Harbaugh dropping back in the fourth quarter and uncorking a soaring spiral that rose high and long as flanker John Kolesar ran underneath it, his steps seemingly in sync with the revolutions of the ball, so [that] when it fell, it fell right into his arms, almost gently.\"[33]  Harbaugh completed 16 of 19 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns.[32]\\nIn the final three games of the 1985 regular season, Harbaugh completed 41 of 50 passes for 706 yards, nine touchdowns, and no interceptions.[34] For the season as a whole, he completed 145 of 227 passes for 1,976 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions.[26] He also led the nation with a 163.7 passing efficiency rating in 1985.[35]\\nIn 1986, his final season at Michigan, Harbaugh started all 13 games at quarterback for the 1986 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled an 11–2 record, lost to Arizona State in the 1987 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 8 in the final AP Poll and No. 7 in the final UPI Poll.[36]\\nIn the first game of the season, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 24–23 victory over Notre Dame. Harbaugh completed 15 of 23 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown.\\nIn the fourth game of the season, he broke his own Michigan school record with 310 passing yards in Schembechler\\'s 200th career victory, a 34–17 victory over Wisconsin.[37]\\nHarbaugh caused controversy when he guaranteed a victory over Ohio State in 1986.  Harbaugh\\'s guarantee proved valid as the Wolverines defeated the Buckeyes, 26–24. Harbaugh completed 19 of 29 passes with two interceptions.[38]\\nFor the season, Harbaugh completed 180 of 277 passes for 2,729 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.[26]  His 2,729 passing yards set a Michigan season record that stood until 2002.  He also finished second in the country in passing efficiency behind Heisman Trophy winner Vinny Testaverde.[39]  Harbaugh won numerous honors in 1986 including the following:\\nHarbaugh finished his college career as Michigan\\'s all-time record holder for passing yards with 5,449 yards. He also tallied 620 passing attempts (second in Michigan history at the time), 387 completions, a 62.4% completion percentage, 31 touchdown passes (third in Michigan history at the time), and 22 interceptions. He held the career NCAA Division I-A passing efficiency record (149.6) for 12 years.[44]  Harbaugh earned a B.A. in communications from Michigan\\'s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1986.[45]\\nThe Chicago Bears selected Harbaugh in the first round (26th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft.[46] During the 1987 season, playing under head coach Mike Ditka, Harbaugh completed only one of 15 passes in an August 27 exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals.[47]  During the regular season, he played in a reserve capacity in six games. On November 22, in a 30–10 win over the Detroit Lions, Harbaugh took only one snap and was sacked for 15 yards. On December 14, in a 41–0 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Harbaugh threw his first NFL passes, completing 8 of 11 (72.7%) for 62 yards, was sacked 3 times for 30 yards, and rushed 15 yards on three carries.[48]\\nHarbaugh played 10 games in 1988 and completed 47 of 97 passes (48.5%) for 514 yards and 2 interceptions. He also rushed 110 yards on 19 carries.[49] Harbaugh started his first game on Week 14 (December 5), a 23–3 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in which he completed 11 of 30 passes for 108 yards and 2 interceptions, rushed 32 yards on 6 carries, and was sacked twice for 9 yards.[50][51] The following game on December 12, Harbaugh earned his first win as an NFL starter with a 13–12 victory over the Detroit Lions. Harbaugh completed 18 of 26 passes for 174 yards and rushed 36 yards in 7 carries.[51] Harbaugh\\'s 1988 season completion percentage as a QB in the NFL was the lowest during his 15-year career at 48.5%.[52]\\nHarbaugh saw more playing time in 1989 after Jim McMahon left the team and started five games for Chicago while Mike Tomczak started 11 in a 6–10 season for Chicago.[53] 1989 was his first season with over 1,000 passing yards, completing 111 of 178 passes in 12 games for 1,204 yards for 5 touchdowns and 9 interceptions and was sacked 18 times for 106 yards.[53] His 62.4% completion rate earned him the team record for single-season completion percentage.[54]\\nIn 1990, Harbaugh played and started in the first 14 games of the season.[51] Chicago improved to 11–5 and won the NFC Central division, and Harbaugh passed for 2,178 yards with 180 of 312 (57.7%) passes completed for 10 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. He was sacked 31 times for 206 yards and rushed 321 yards in 51 carries.[55] Due to a shoulder injury, Harbaugh sat out the last two games of the year as well as the playoffs.[56]\\nHarbaugh passed for a career-high 3,121 yards with Chicago in 1991 and became the first Chicago quarterback since Vince Evans to start all 16 regular season games.[57] He completed 275 of 478 (57.5%) passes for 15 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, was sacked 24 times (including a franchise-record 9 times on Oct 25 against Minnesota) for a loss of 163 yards, and rushed 338 yards on 70 carries.[49] Chicago finished the season 11–5 like the year before, but in second place in the NFC Central. On December 29, 1991, he made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card game, a 17–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas defense overwhelmed him throughout the game, sacking him three times; and in the final drive of the game that started from Chicago\\'s 4-yard line with 1:50 left, he threw an interception to Bill Bates on the fourth play from scrimmage.[58] As of 2017[update], however, his franchise records for completions (22), attempts (44) and yards per game in the 1991 postseason (218) still stood.\\nChicago regressed to a 5–11 record in 1992, and the team fired coach Ditka afterwards.[59] Harbaugh played all 16 games but started only 13 and had a 5–8 record as starter. He completed 202 of 358 (56.4%) passes for 2,486 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, was sacked 31 times for 167 yards, and rushed 272 yards over 47 carries, including one rushing touchdown.[60]\\nIn 1993, Chicago went 7–9. Harbaugh played in and started 15 games and completed 200 of 325 (61.5%) passes for 2,002 yards, 7 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He was sacked 43 times for 210 yards and rushed 277 yards over 60 carries.[61] Harbaugh ended his tenure with Chicago with a 35–30 (.538) record.[62]\\nOn April 7, 1994, Harbaugh signed with the Indianapolis Colts.[63] He played and started in just nine games in the 1994 Colts season, completing 125 of 202 (61.9%) passes for 1,440 yards, 9 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. Harbaugh took 17 sacks for 72 yards and rushed 223 yards over 39 carries.[49] For the first eight games, Harbaugh was starter, and coach Ted Marchibroda re-instated Harbaugh as starter for Week 15 (December 18) after Indianapolis struggled on offense under quarterback Don Majkowski.[64]\\nIn 1995, Harbaugh achieved career highs in completion percentage (63.7%), passer rating (100.7), and touchdown passes (17) and led Indianapolis to the AFC Championship Game. Harbaugh played 15 games in the regular season and started 12, with a 7–5 record as starter for a 9–7 team.[65] Harbaugh completed 200 of 314 passes for 2,575 yards and just 5 interceptions with his 17 touchdowns and was sacked 36 times for 219 yards. In 52 carries, Harbaugh rushed for 235 yards and two touchdowns.[49] But he strained his right knee after being sacked six times and left the Week 14 (December 3) game against the Carolina Panthers in the third quarter.[66]\\nIndianapolis lost to defending AFC champion the San Diego Chargers in Week 16 (December 17) 27–24, with John Carney kicking the winning field goal with 3 seconds left after Harbaugh\\'s drive with three straight passes had led to Cary Blanchard\\'s field goal that tied the game at 24 with 48 seconds left.[67]\\nIn the regular season finale on December 23, Harbaugh\\'s 32nd birthday, Indianapolis clinched a playoff berth with a 10–7 win over the New England Patriots. Completing 20 of 30 passes, he threw for 225 yards and a touchdown.[68]\\nOn December 31, 1995, in the AFC wild card game against San Diego, Harbaugh scored on a 3-yard quarterback sneak in the fourth quarter after a 32-yard interception return by Jason Belser and Indianapolis won 35–20.[69] Indianapolis won the divisional round game on January 7, 1996 over the Kansas City Chiefs 10–7, despite only 112 passing yards (with 12 of 27 passes completed, 1 touchdown and 1 interception) from Harbaugh.[51] In the AFC Championship Game on January 14, Harbaugh completed 21 of 33 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown and rushed 29 yards on 6 carries.[51] But Aaron Bailey dropped Harbaugh\\'s last-second Hail Mary pass in the endzone, and the Pittsburgh Steelers won 20–16 and went on to Super Bowl XXX, which they lost to the Dallas Cowboys.[70]  For the season, he was voted to the Pro Bowl, was named Comeback Player of the Year and AFC Player of the Year.\\nWith new coach Lindy Infante, Indianapolis again finished 9–7 and made the playoffs in 1996 with Harbaugh as signal caller. Harbaugh played and started in 14 games with a 7–7 record; he completed 232 of 405 (57.3%) passes for 2,630 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, with 36 sacks for 190 yards lost and 192 rushing yards on 48 carries and a touchdown.[71] Defending AFC Champion Pittsburgh Steelers defeated Indianapolis in the Wild Card round 42–14 as Harbaugh completed only 37.5% of his passes (12 of 32) for 134 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception.[51]\\nIndianapolis fell to 3–13 in 1997. Despite passing for 2,060 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions in 12 games and 189-for-309 (61.2%) passing, Harbaugh had a 2–9 record as starter.[72] Harbaugh was sacked 41 times for a career-high 256 yards lost.[49]\\nOn February 14, 1998, the Indianapolis Colts traded Harbaugh to the Baltimore Ravens for third-round and fourth-round draft picks in the 1998 NFL Draft. With that trade, Harbaugh reunited with his former Colts coach Ted Marchibroda.[73] During the 1998 season with Baltimore, Harbaugh played in 14 games and started 12, with a 5–7 record as starter in a 6–10 season for the Ravens.[74] Harbaugh completed 164 of 293 (56.0%) passes for 1,839 yards, just his third season with fewer than 2,000 passing yards since 1989. He had 12 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in passing, was sacked 23 times for 145 yards, and rushed 172 yards on 40 carries.[49]\\nThe Ravens opened a new stadium for 1998, Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards (renamed M&T Bank Stadium in 2003). Starting the game in Week 1 (September 6) and completing 4 of 7 passes for 33 yards, Harbaugh left during the second quarter after injuring a finger, and with backup Eric Zeier in for Harbaugh, Baltimore lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 20–13.[51][75] Baltimore won its next game 24–10 over the New York Jets on September 13; Harbaugh started and made 5 of 10 passes for 36 yards but again left early and was replaced by Zeier due to injury.[76] Coach Marchibroda again split quarterbacking duties in the following game on September 20, a 24–10 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Harbaugh starting and Zeier taking over during the second quarter. With 4 of 9 passes completed for 59 yards, Harbaugh led a drive for a Matt Stover first quarter field goal.[77]\\nHarbaugh then sat out two games and played as Zeier\\'s backup for Weeks 7 (October 18) and 8 (October 25). Those two games had poor performances: Harbaugh completed none of six passes and had one 3-yard rush in the Week 6 loss to Pittsburgh. Despite only 9 of 20 passes completed and two interceptions in the Week 7 28–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers, Harbaugh made his first passing touchdown as a Raven, a 46-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis in the fourth quarter.[51][78] In the next game on Week 8 (November 1), Harbaugh improved in his first full game, with 27 of 34 passes completed over 243 yards for 3 touchdowns and 1 interception and 57 rushing yards in 10 carries.[79] In Week 9 (November 8), with Baltimore winning 13–10 over the Oakland Raiders, Harbaugh got his first win in a full game started despite passing for only 102 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception.[51] In the final two drives of the game, Harbaugh made crucial first-down conversion passes of a 28-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis and 10- and 11-yard passes to Michael Jackson.[80] In Week 12 (November 29), a 38-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, Harbaugh had his first interception-free full game, with 16-for-25 passing over 198 yards for 2 touchdowns. It was the Colts first trip back to Baltimore after the team left it for Indianapolis. In an emotional moment, Harbaugh presented Johnny Unitas with the game ball.[51]\\nReferee Ed Hochuli called a controversial unnecessary roughness penalty against Joe Bowden in Baltimore\\'s 16–14 loss to the Tennessee Oilers for his hit on Harbaugh on a 2nd-and-24 play with Tennessee leading 14–13 after his 9-yard scramble towards the sideline, ruling that Harbaugh was in bounds when hit. On 3rd-and-15 in the next series, however, Harbaugh was sacked and Baltimore was forced to punt, so the penalty didn\\'t hurt the Oilers.[81] Harbaugh completed 15 of 28 passes for 214 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and rushed 22 yards over 5 carries.[51] After a three-game losing streak, Harbaugh won the final game of the season (and his final game with Baltimore) on December 27, 19–10 over the Detroit Lions with 17 of 26 passes completed for 141 yards and a touchdown.[51]\\nHarbaugh played two years with the San Diego Chargers. In the 1999 season, Harbaugh started 12 games out of 14 played and had a 6–6 record as starter in an 8–8 season. Harbaugh completed 249 of 434 (57.4%) passes for 2,761 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. He was sacked 37 times for a total loss of 208 yards and rushed for 126 yards over 34 carries.[49]\\nIn his debut with San Diego in the September 19 season opener (Week 2), Harbaugh threw two touchdowns in 15-for-27 passing for 159 yards in a 34–7 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.[51] However, San Diego lost their next game to Harbaugh\\'s former team, the Indianapolis Colts, 27–19. Harbaugh completed 15 of 37 passes for 188 yards. With very few seconds left and the ball on the Colts\\' 24, Harbaugh threw an interception to Tyrone Poole.[82]  Harbaugh started the Week 4 (October 3) game against the Kansas City Chiefs completing 6 of 9 passes for 38 yards and an interception before leaving due to a bruised right elbow;[51][83]  he missed the Week 5 (October 10) and Week 6 (October 17) games because of that injury and two broken ribs.[84][85] Harbaugh returned in Week 7 (October 24) in a 31–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers as backup to starter Erik Kramer; both quarterbacks threw 3 interceptions each.[86] Harbaugh next started a game on Week 9 (November 7) and completed 25 of 39 passes for 235 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions and rushed 14 yards in 2 carries in a 33–17 loss to defending champion Denver Broncos.[51] The Chargers lost its sixth game in a row after a 4–1 start in Week 12 (November 28) to the Minnesota Vikings 35–27.[87] Robert Griffith intercepted a Harbaugh pass at the Vikings\\' 1-yard line with 4:29 left, and Minnesota ran out the clock to seal the win.[88]\\nA 12–9 loss to the Miami Dolphins on December 19 (Week 15) disqualified the Chargers from the postseason. Miami\\'s defense sacked Harbaugh five times, and Rich Owens strip-sacked Harbaugh at San Diego\\'s 20-yard line. Harbaugh finished the game with 20 of 40 passes completed for 178 yards. With 17 seconds left, Chris Penn caught Harbaugh\\'s attempt at a game-winning touchdown pass albeit slightly outside the back of the end zone. John Carney missed a game-tying 36-yard field goal.[89]  After failing to make a passing touchdown for three games, Harbaugh made two passing touchdowns and just one interception on 23-for-36 passing over 325 yards in San Diego\\'s 23–20 win over the Oakland Raiders on the home finale on December 26 (Week 16).[90]\\nFollowing an 8–8 season in 1999, San Diego finished 1–15 in 2000 with a rotation of Ryan Leaf, Harbaugh, and Moses Moreno as starters.[91] Playing in seven games and starting five, Harbaugh completed 123 of 202 (60.9%) passes for 1,416 yards, 8 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, was sacked 14 times for 96 yards, and rushed 24 yards on 16 carries.[49]\\nHarbaugh played his first game in Week 4 (September 24), a 20–12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. On 8-for-14 passing, Harbaugh passed for 67 yards and an interception. He became starter in Week 5 (October 1). In the 57–31 loss to defending champion St. Louis Rams, Harbaugh was 27-for-40 for 348 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and was sacked 3 times for 15 yards. Starting the Week 6 (October 8) game, a 21–7 loss the Denver Broncos, Harbaugh was 18-for-43 for 237 yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions.[92] Two of Harbaugh\\'s interceptions led to short Denver touchdowns, and Harbaugh threw his third interception on fourth-and-goal at Denver\\'s 5-yard line.[93] In Week 7 (October 15), an overtime 27–24 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Harbaugh\\'s second interception of the game, by Henry Jones, was in overtime and paved way for Steve Christie\\'s game-winning field goal. Following the game, coach Mike Riley said he regretted rotating between Harbaugh and Moses Moreno in the first half, as Moreno lost two fumbles, one of which Buffalo returned for a touchdown.[94]\\nSan Diego had an ESPN Sunday Night Football game in Week 9 (October 29) following a bye week, lost to the Oakland Raiders 15–13, and fell to 0–8. San Diego took a 13–12 lead with 5:47 left after Harbaugh made a 21-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Jones, but failed the two-point conversion attempt paving the way for the Raiders\\' Sebastian Janikowski to kick the winning field goal with 13 seconds left.[95] In the final play of the game, following a 47-yard kickoff return by Ronney Jenkins, Marquez Pope intercepted Harbaugh\\'s attempt at a 50-yard Hail Mary pass that was intended for Trevor Gaylor in the end zone.[96][97] In that game, Harbaugh completed 25 of 35 passes for 222 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and was sacked 3 times for 27 yards.[92] The following game on November 5 (Week 10), San Diego lost its ninth straight in a 15–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. In the second quarter, Harbaugh lost two fumbles, both of which preceded 10-yard Seattle passing touchdowns. Having completed 22 of 32 passes for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception, he left the game after the third quarter due to groin and abdomen injuries.[98]\\nHarbaugh played what would be his final career game in Week 11 (November 12), a 17–7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[51] In the final drive of the game he filled in poorly for an injured Ryan Leaf, completing only 2 of 5 passes for 19 yards and throwing an interception. By that time, coach Riley had relegated Harbaugh to emergency duty due to injuries including a mild hernia.[99] Riley had planned to start Harbaugh for the next game on Week 12 (November 19), but decided to start Leaf instead.[100][93]\\nHarbaugh signed with the Detroit Lions prior to the 2001 season, where he was expected to back up incumbent starter Charlie Batch. However, on the eve of the regular season, the Lions cut him and traded for Ty Detmer. He then closed out his NFL career with the Carolina Panthers in 2001, where he dressed for 6 games but didn\\'t play. The 2001 Panthers, like the Chargers the year before, finished with a 1–15 record.\\nFor his NFL career, Harbaugh played in 177 league games with 140 starts. He completed 2,305 of 3,918 passes for 26,288 yards with 129 touchdowns. Particularly during his time with Indianapolis, such as when he led the Colts to come-from-behind wins over the Chiefs and Chargers in the 1995–96 NFL playoffs and a near upset over the No. 2 AFC seed Steelers, he earned the nickname \"Captain Comeback\" (the second player to be so nicknamed after Roger Staubach) for his ability to win games in the fourth quarter when his team was significantly behind.\\nHarbaugh is second in the Bears\\' record book for completions with 1,023, while Jay Cutler holds the record with 1,034.[101] Harbaugh also ranks second with 1,759 attempts and third in yards with 11,567.[62] In January 2005, he was inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor as one of the most successful and popular players in the club\\'s Indianapolis era.[5]\\nDuring his final eight seasons in the NFL (1994–2001), Harbaugh was an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant coach under his father Jack Harbaugh at Western Kentucky University (WKU). Serving as an offensive consultant, he scouted and recruited high school student-athletes throughout several states including Florida, Indiana and Illinois. He was involved in recruiting 17 players on WKU\\'s 2002 Division I-AA national champion team. His father was a football coach for 18 years, including 14 years as head coach at WKU.[5]\\nHarbaugh was quarterback coach for the Oakland Raiders in 2002 and 2003 under Bill Callahan.[5] During his tenure with the Raiders, Harbaugh coached starting quarterback Rich Gannon, who led the Raiders\\' run to Super Bowl XXXVII, won the 2002 AP NFL MVP award, and was selected to the 2003 Pro Bowl after the 2002 season.[102]  Other Raiders quarterbacks coached by Harbaugh include Rick Mirer, Tee Martin, Marques Tuiasosopo, and Rob Johnson.\\nPrior to the 2004 season, Harbaugh was named head football coach at the University of San Diego. In his first year, he directed the Toreros to an overall mark of 7–4, including 5 straight wins to end the season. The following year, the team improved to 11–1 and won the 2005 Pioneer Football League championship. In 2006, USD again went 11–1, winning their second consecutive Pioneer League title in the process.\\nHarbaugh was named the head football coach at Stanford University in December 2006, replacing Walt Harris. Harbaugh\\'s father, Jack, was Stanford\\'s defensive coordinator from 1980 to 1981, while Harbaugh attended Palo Alto High School, located directly across the street from Stanford Stadium.[103]\\nHarbaugh stirred some intra-conference controversy in March 2007, when he was quoted as saying rival USC head coach \"Pete Carroll\\'s only got one more year, though. He\\'ll be there one more year. That\\'s what I\\'ve heard. I heard it inside the staff.\" Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll.[104] (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating \"There is no question in my mind that USC is the best team in the country and may be the best team in the history of college football.\" The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.[105][106] Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history.[107][108] Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009.[109] Stanford\\'s 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans\\' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll\\'s first November loss as USC head coach. After an infamous \"What\\'s your deal?\" verbal exchange with Carroll following that game, Harbaugh and Carroll would go on to speak favorably about each other as NFL coaches.[110]  Harbaugh never lost in USC\\'s home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\\nIn January 2009, Harbaugh was confirmed to have been interviewed by the New York Jets for the head coach position,[111] although the job was eventually offered to Rex Ryan.[112]\\nIn 2009, the Cardinal had a comeback season, finishing the regular season at 8–4, finishing #21 in the polls, and receiving an invitation to play in the 2009 Sun Bowl, the Cardinal\\'s first bowl appearance since 2001. Running back Toby Gerhart was named a Heisman Trophy finalist, finishing second to Mark Ingram II in the closest margin of voting in Heisman history. On December 13, 2009, Harbaugh was rewarded with a three-year contract extension through the 2014 season.[113]\\nThe 2010 season brought more success for Harbaugh and the Cardinal. The team went 11–1 in the regular season, with their only loss coming from Oregon, a team that was undefeated and earned a berth in the BCS National Championship Game. The first 11 win season in program history earned the Cardinal a #4 BCS ranking and a BCS bowl invitation to the Orange Bowl. Stanford defeated Virginia Tech 40–12 for the Cardinal\\'s first bowl win since 1996 and the first BCS bowl victory in program history.[114] Second year starting quarterback Andrew Luck was the runner-up to for the Heisman Trophy, the second year in a row that the runner-up was from Stanford. Harbaugh was named the winner of the Woody Hayes Coach of the Year Award.[115]\\nOn January 7, 2011, four days after winning the Orange Bowl, Harbaugh agreed to a five-year, $25 million contract to become the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers.[115] He succeeded Jim Tomsula, who was interim head coach for only the last game of the preceding season after succeeding the fired Mike Singletary. Prior to Harbaugh\\'s arrival, the 49ers had not had a winning season nor a playoff appearance since 2002.\\nThough the 49ers were expected to struggle in what was anticipated to be a rebuilding season,[116] with a new scheme and many new players as well as shortened summer practices due to the lockout, Harbaugh led the team to a 13–3 record in the regular season, winning the NFC West division while finishing second overall in the NFC and bringing the team to the NFC Championship Game. This was the first time the 49ers had made the playoffs since 2002, generating widespread praise.[117][118]\\nOn November 24, Harbaugh played his brother John and the Baltimore Ravens, losing the Thanksgiving showdown 16–6. John and Jim Harbaugh are the first pair of brothers to serve as NFL head coaches in the same season.[119]\\nHarbaugh\\'s work in San Francisco had resulted in an extremely successful season, revitalizing the career of quarterback Alex Smith and with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio creating one of the leading defensive squads of the 2011 season. The 49ers\\' season ended with a 20–17 loss in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants in the NFC Championship Game. At the conclusion of the season, Harbaugh was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year.\\nIn the 2012 season, Harbaugh resolved a quarterback controversy by replacing incumbent starter Alex Smith with backup Colin Kaepernick. Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 19–5–1 as a starter under Harbaugh, while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength.[120][121] Smith began 2012 with a 6–2 record as a starter before suffering a concussion in the following game.[122][123] He missed the following game, and Kaepernick was 16 for 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns in a 32–7 win over the Chicago Bears.[123] Harbaugh was impressed with Kaepernick, and said \"we have two quarterbacks that have a hot hand\" while dismissing any rule that a player should not lose their starting job due to an injury.[124][125] Smith was medically cleared to play the day before the next game, but Harbaugh chose not to rush him back and again started Kaepernick, who threw and ran for a touchdown in a 31–21 win over the New Orleans Saints.[126][127] The following week, Harbaugh announced that Kaepernick would start for the 8–2–1 49ers, while also stating that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent.[128] However, Kaepernick remained the starter for the remainder of the season as the 49ers again qualified for the playoffs.[122]\\nHarbaugh led the team to an 11–4–1 record in the regular season, winning back to back NFC West titles.[129] Harbaugh\\'s quarterback decision was on display in the first game of the playoffs.[122] The 49ers won 45–31 over the Green Bay Packers, as Kaepernick had 444 yards of total offense (263 passing, 181 rushing) and four touchdowns. Kaepernick set the record for rushing yards by a quarterback in any NFL game with his 181-yard outburst against Green Bay.[130] On January 20 in the NFC Championship Game, Harbaugh led the 49ers to a 28–24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, which sent the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, and on February 3, Harbaugh faced his older brother, John and the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl.[131] It was the first time that the opposing teams\\' head coaches in the Super Bowl were brothers; the Ravens won the game with a score of 34–31 despite a third quarter comeback by the 49ers.\\nIn the 2013 season, Harbaugh led the 49ers to a 12–4 regular-season record and a third consecutive appearance in both the playoffs and NFC Championship Game, where they lost to the Seattle Seahawks 23–17, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII. In doing so, Harbaugh became the first NFL head coach to reach a conference championship game in each of his first three seasons.[132]\\nThe 49ers had an 8–8 season in 2014, failing to reach the playoffs for the first time under the Harbaugh era. On October 5, it was rumored that Harbaugh would not return in 2015 regardless of that season\\'s outcome, though owner Jed York denied the claims at the time.[133] It has been suggested that Harbaugh, despite his success on the field, was involved in a power struggle with 49ers general manager Trent Baalke starting from the 2013 season onward.[134][135] On December 28, 2014, the 49ers announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways with Harbaugh as their head coach.[136] York claims Harbaugh and the 49ers agreed to mutually part ways immediately after a win over the Arizona Cardinals in the final week of the regular season.[137] Harbaugh, however, later said: \"I didn\\'t leave the 49ers. I felt like the 49er hierarchy left me.\"[138] He further added that the 49ers informed him that he would no longer be the 49ers coach after suffering a loss on December 14, but that he decided to remain as the team\\'s head coach for the final two games of the season because \"I wanted to finish what I started—what we started.\"[139]\\nHarbaugh left the 49ers as one of their most successful head coaches in just four years, as well as becoming the first successful NFL head coach to depart for a college team.[134][135] New head coach Jim Tomsula was fired after just one season in which the 49ers finished 5–11. Until the 2019 season, in which the 49ers went 13–3 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV, the 49ers had losing seasons every year following Harbaugh\\'s departure.\\nOn December 30, 2014, Harbaugh was introduced by the University of Michigan as the school\\'s new head football coach.[140] His return to Michigan was the subject of a book, Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football, by John U. Bacon.[141]\\nOn September 3, 2015, Harbaugh lost his first game as head coach of Michigan, a 24–17 road loss against Utah. On September 12, Michigan won, 35–7, against Oregon State, giving Harbaugh his first win as Michigan\\'s head coach. On September 26, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 31–0 victory over No. 22-ranked Brigham Young University, leading Michigan to move into #22 in the A.P. Top 25. This was Michigan\\'s first appearance in the AP Top 25 since 2013.  On October 3, Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 28–0 shutout win against the Maryland Terrapins, posting back to back shutouts for the first time since 2000.[142] The following week, Michigan beat #13 Northwestern 38–0, making the Wolverines the first team with a pair of 30-point shutouts against ranked opponents since Notre Dame\\'s 1966 championship team.[143] He finished his first season as the Wolverines\\' head coach with a 10–3 record, with losses against Utah, Michigan State, and against Ohio State,[144] with a redeeming victory in the Citrus Bowl over No. 19 Florida, 41–7. After being tied, 7–7, in the first quarter, Michigan scored 34 unanswered points as they held Florida to just 28 yards in the second half.[145]\\nAfter defeating Hawaii in the opening game of the 2016 season, Michigan was ranked No. 5 in the AP poll.  It was the first time Michigan had been ranked in the top five since the start of the 2007 season. Michigan would then cruise through its non-conference slate before defeating #8 Wisconsin. This was Michigan\\'s first win over a top ten ranked team since 2008. In week six, the Wolverines soundly defeated Rutgers 78–0, the third-largest margin of victory in program history and the largest margin since 1920.[146] Three weeks later, Michigan defeated Michigan State on the road, its first victory in East Lansing since 2007.[147] They then suffered their first loss of the season to Iowa, before beating Indiana for their 10th victory; Harbaugh is one of only two coaches in program history to win 10 games in each of his first two seasons as head coach, joining Fielding H. Yost (1901–02). The regular season finished with a highly anticipated matchup against #2 Ohio State, with a likely College Football Playoff bid on the line. In a game that went to two overtime periods, Ohio State finally defeated the Wolverines 30–27; Harbaugh said afterward he was \"bitterly disappointed with the officiating\", especially for a controversial 4th-and-1 call, and was reprimanded by the Big Ten with a $10,000 fine. Michigan finished the season in the Orange Bowl, where it lost 33–32 to #10 Florida State, after losing Heisman-finalist Jabrill Peppers before the game and losing two-time All-American Jake Butt early in the game.[148] Michigan finished the season 10–3 and another third-place finish in their division.\\nMichigan finished the season in the Outback Bowl, losing 19–26 to South Carolina, becoming the only team in the Big Ten Conference to lose its bowl game in the 2017-2018 bowl season and giving them an 8–5 record on the year.[149][150]\\nMichigan began the 2018 season ranked 14 in the AP poll. They lost their first game of the season against No. 12 Notre Dame 17–24, but rebounded the next two weeks with a 49–3 win over Western Michigan University and a 45–20 win over SMU. Three weeks later, the 5–1 Wolverines faced the No. 15 Wisconsin Badgers in a Saturday night showdown. Michigan won the game 38–13, moving to No. 6 in the AP Poll.[151] The next week, the Wolverines beat rival Michigan State 21–7, moving to 5th in the AP Poll. After a bye week, the Wolverines trampled Penn State 42–7, moving to 4th in both the AP poll and the College Football Playoff Rankings. They would stay at that ranking after a 31–20 win over Indiana that earned the Wolverines a share of the East Division title. Michigan lost at #10 Ohio State 62–39, denying Michigan a chance to play in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State\\'s 62 points set a record for points against Michigan in regulation. Harbaugh became the first Michigan coach to lose his first four starts against the Buckeyes. The Wolverines then lost to the Florida Gators 41–15 in the Peach Bowl, finishing with another 10–3 season.[152]\\nDuring Harbaugh\\'s fifth season, the Wolverines lost to Wisconsin 35–14 and to Penn State 28–21, both on the road. Michigan won decisively against rivals Notre Dame 45–14 and Michigan State 44–10, but concluded the regular season with a loss to then #1-ranked Ohio State by a score of 56–27 to end the regular season. When asked about the gap between the two schools, his reply was testy: \"I\\'ll answer your questions, not your insults.\"[153] The Wolverines finished the season in the Citrus Bowl, where they lost to Alabama, 35-16. Michigan finished the season 9-4 overall.\\nOn November 14, Michigan hosted Wisconsin and Michigan suffered its largest halftime deficit at home since Michigan Stadium opened in 1927 (28–0), as well as its largest home loss (49–11) since 1935.[154][155]  On November 28, 2020, Michigan hosted Penn State and for the first time in Michigan football history, lost to a team that was 0–5 or worse.[156]  Michigan was winless at home during the 2020 season, marking the first time in program history that Michigan did not win any games at home.[157]\\nOn January 8, 2021, Michigan signed Harbaugh to a four-year contract extension through the 2025 season.[158] Michigan, led by Harbaugh, finished the regular season 11–1. The Wolverines beat Western Michigan, Washington, Northern Illinois, Rutgers, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Northwestern, Indiana, No. 23 Penn State, and Maryland.[159] Michigan\\'s lone loss came in a top-10 matchup on the road at Michigan State. Following the loss, according to Harbaugh, the Big Ten acknowledged that there were errors made by the officials on multiple calls, including one that could have resulted in a Michigan touchdown.[160] Michigan ended the regular season with a 42–27 victory over Ohio State, giving Harbaugh his first win over Ohio State and his second Big Ten East divisional title. Michigan advanced to the Big Ten Championship Game for the first time, where the Wolverines defeated Iowa in Indianapolis, 42–3, earning an Orange Bowl berth against Georgia in the College Football Playoff.[161] Following the season he was named the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award.[162] By winning the award, Michigan became the first school to win both the AP coach of the year in men\\'s basketball (Juwan Howard) and football since the football award was established in 1998.[163]\\nIn January 2022, reports emerged that Harbaugh would take the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job if he was offered it.[164] Although he never interviewed with the Raiders, Harbaugh did interview with the Minnesota Vikings in late January and was a lead candidate for a head coaching job.[165] Reports emerged that Harbaugh was preparing to accept the Minnesota Vikings head coaching position if he was offered it. Harbaugh did not receive an offer following his second interview with the Vikings, and informed the University of Michigan that he would be returning to coach the Wolverines in the 2022 season.[166]\\nHarbaugh comes from a coaching family, and is the son of college football coach Jack Harbaugh. He has seven children. From his first marriage to Miah Harbaugh (m. 1996–2006),[167] he has sons Jay (a graduate of Oregon State University and the runningback coach at the University of Michigan),[168] and James (a theater graduate from the University of Michigan’s School of Music, Theatre & Dance); and a daughter, Grace (a water polo player and history of art major at the University of Michigan). From his second marriage to Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh (m. 2008),[169] he has two daughters, Addison and Katherine, and two sons, Jack (named after his grandfather) and John (named after his uncle).[170][171] Harbaugh is a Roman Catholic who has done charity work in Piura, Peru.[172][173]\\nJim Harbaugh\\'s older brother, John, is the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, and they became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history, facing each other in the Thanksgiving Classic game in 2011 and Super Bowl XLVII on February 3, 2013.\\nIn 1994, Harbaugh appeared as a cowboy in the Western/science fiction show The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. He also made an appearance on the popular TV show Saved by the Bell in 1996, playing the cousin of the character Screech.\\nHarbaugh was the co-owner of Panther Racing in the IndyCar Series. The main car for the team carried Harbaugh\\'s old jersey number, 4. When the team won the 2001 and 2002 IRL championship, the team, which had the option of going to No. 1, chose instead to keep the No. 4 for its association with Harbaugh\\'s career.[174]\\nOn October 30, 2005, Harbaugh was arrested for DUI after running a stop sign in Encinitas, California.[175] He initially pleaded not guilty, but later entered into a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to three years of probation, a $1,300 fine and a drunken-driving educational program. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports his blood-alcohol level was .09.[176][177][178]\\nIn November 2012, Harbaugh had a cardioversion procedure to correct an arrhythmia (i.e., an abnormal heartbeat rhythm).[179]\\nHarbaugh has championed equal access to justice for Americans through his involvement with the Legal Services Corporation (LSC).[180] On June 13, 2017, Harbaugh spoke in Washington, D.C. in the Senate Building about the gap in access to justice for low-income earning Americans which was showcased in the 2017 LSC report, \"The Justice Gap: Measuring the Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans.\"[181]\\nHarbaugh has also stated his opposition to abortion. In a podcast interview in April 2020, Harbaugh labeled medical abortion as \"horrendous\" and said, \"And lastly, abortion—we talk about sanctity of life, yet we live in a society that aborts babies. There can\\'t be anything more horrendous.\"[182] In July 2022, speaking at an anti-abortion event Harbaugh said, \"Have the courage to let the unborn be born\".[183][184][185]\\nYou got Jim Harbaugh, the coach of Michigan football, marching today.

It has to be equal and fair to all, and no one can be above the law.\"[187][188] On June 2, 2020, a week after Floyd\\'s murder, Harbaugh participated in an anti-police brutality commemorative protest in Ann Arbor.[189] Michigan offensive coach Josh Gattis separately thanked Harbaugh and his family for their impact on African American coaches and players, stating \"in challenging times of racial inequality and injustice I am even more thankful for the Harbaugh Family!\" Gattis credited Harbaugh for \"the fairness and promotion of black coaches in leadership roles like David Shaw, Derek Mason, Willie Taggart, Jim Caldwell, Pep Hamilton\" and himself.[190] Harbaugh\\'s participation in the equality and anti-brutality protest was also singled out by former President Barack Obama, who praised him for \"being on the right side of this issue.\"[186]\\n# denotes interim head coach\\n# denotes interim head coach\\nThe Basilica of St. Bartholomew on the Island (Italian: Basilica di San Bartolomeo all\\'Isola, Latin: Basilica S. Bartholomaei in Insula) is a titular minor basilica, located in Rome, Italy. It was founded in 998 by Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor and contains relics of St. Bartholomew the Apostle.[2] It is located on Tiber Island, on the site of the former temple of Aesculapius, which had cleansed the island of its former ill-repute among the Romans and established its reputation as a hospital, continued under Christian auspices today.\\nIts cardinal priest has been Cardinal Blase Cupich since 19 November 2016.\\nIn Roman times, the Temple of Aesculapius stood on the site of the modern church. The entire Isola Tiberina had actually been covered in marble in an effort to make the island look like a ship. The prow can still be seen today.[3]\\nEmperor Otto built this church, which was initially dedicated to his friend Adalbert of Prague. It was renovated by Pope Paschal II in 1113 and again in 1180, after its rededication upon the arrival of the relics of the apostle Bartholomew. The relics were sent to Rome from Benevento, where they had arrived from Armenia in 809. The relics are located within an ancient Roman porphyry bathtub with lions\\' heads, under the main altar. The marble wellhead bears the figures of the Savior, Adalbert and Bartholomew and Otto III.\\nThe church was badly damaged by a flood in 1557 and was reconstructed, with its present Baroque façade, in 1624, to designs of Orazio Torriani. Further restorations were undertaken in 1852.  The interior of the church preserves fourteen ancient Roman columns and two lion supports that date from the earliest reconstruction of the basilica.\\nThe inscriptions found in S.

During the Qing dynasty, it was the Manchu style of an imperial-born princess of an emperor. Daughters of the all imperial princes above the rank of jiangjun also used the same title.\\nWhen a Manchu prince had concubines, the status of the wives, from highest to lowest, are the following: difujin (the official wife), cefujin (the first rank concubine), and gege.  Historically, there were many gege, but few ever ascended to the status of cefujin. A gege could also be a daughter of imperial princess, even if she was promoted to gulun or heshuo princess. Only difujin and cefujin names are recorded in the imperial family lists of family members.\\nBefore the establishment of the Qing dynasty, the daughters of khans were referred to as \"gege\" by personal names or the names of lands they lived after the marriage. After 1658, the personal names of imperial princesses were not recorded in imperial genealogy.All the titles for imperial princesses were conferred upon the marriage. Sometimes title could be granted before the marriage. The following titles were granted to the princesses born to the emperor:\\nPrior to the formalization of rank system, there existed several ranks typical for Ming dynasty. The following ranks could be granted solely to Emperor\\'s daughter. The prefixes were included in the whole title.\\nHowever, the title of gege was reserved for several mistresses who died before emperor\\'s coronation and were not granted honorifical names. A gege could also be adopted into the imperial palace and raised by dowager consorts and the empress dowager if the emperor did not have enough daughters. The following titles were granted to princesses born to imperial clansmen:\\nThe following stipends were received annually. Rarely, but princesses could be awarded a double annual stipend and be treated as imperial consorts, ex:  Princess Hejing of the First Rank, who was treated as an Imperial Noble Consort and received a double annual stipend. Princesses, who committed a crime, could be stripped of her title and deprived of her stipend.\\nThe described garments below were dictated by the \"Illustrated Precendents for Ritual Paraphernalia of the Imperial Court\" published in 1759.\\n1.

She was described as the most beautiful Manchu woman of Qing dynasty. She was posthumously honoured as \"fujin\" (title reserved for princesses consorts) as the mother of prince consort Fulong\\'an, Prince Jiayong of the Second Rank Fuk\\'anggan.[6]\\nYu Derling (1885-1944) was Western-educated court lady of Empress Dowager Cixi. She stayed in the imperial court from 1905 to 1907, when she married Thaddeus C. White. During her stay, she served as a translator when Empress Dowager received foreign guests.[7] She developed a close relationship with empress dowager, as well as with another Qing dynasty princesses (6th daughter of Yikuang) and princesses consorts (Jingrong) interested in modernisation of the Qing empire.[8] She was rewarded a ruyi scepter and a dragon robe befitting an imperial princess. The similar rewards received mother of Deling and her sister, Rongling.[9] In contrast to earlier historiography, Deling was not a member of imperial clan, but claimed Manchu descent despite her family belonged to Plain White Banner Han forces.[7] Moreover, Deling\\'s books were published under the name of princess Der Ling.[10]\\nLawrence LeShan (September 8, 1920 – November 9, 2020)[1]  was an American psychologist, educator and the author of the best-selling How to Meditate (1974) a practical guide to meditation.[2] He authored or co-authored approximately 75 articles in the professional literature and thirteen books on a diverse range of topics including psychotherapy, war, cancer treatment, and mysticism. He also wrote science fiction under the pseudonym Edward Grendon.\\nLeShan received a bachelor degree from The College of William and Mary, a masters from University of Nebraska and a Ph.D. in Human Development from the University of Chicago. He taught at Pace College, Roosevelt University, and the New School for Social Research. He worked as a clinical and research psychologist for more than 50 years, including six years as a psychologist in the United States Army. He served in the army from 1943 to 1946 and from 1950 to 1952.\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, LeShan conducted extensive research in the field of parapsychology. In his book The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist: Toward a General Theory of the Paranormal, he investigated paranormal topics, mystical thought and quantum mechanics.[3] In the book LeShan claimed to have tested his hypothesis of \"clairvoyant reality\". He said the results were a success and he could heal with mental power and train others to do the same. However, Tim Healey wrote the results were not convincing as nine of his students had eight attempts at using a clairvoyant training technique and all scored four to fives misses.[3]\\nIn World of the Paranormal: The Next Frontier, LeShan advanced his paranormal ideas further, claiming that psychic abilities such as  clairvoyance, precognition and telepathy can be explained using quantum theory.\\nIn the 1980s, LeShan\\'s focus shifted to the psychotherapy of cancer support, a field in which he is considered a pioneer. LeShan lived in New York City. LeShan was married to the late Eda LeShan, who was also a writer.[4] He died at the age of 100 in 2020.[5]\\n\\nRudolph (French: Rodolphe), sometimes called Ralph (Raoul; c. 890 – 14/15 January 936), was the king of France from 923 until his death in 936. He was elected to succeed his father-in-law, Robert I, and spent much of his reign defending his realm from Viking raids.\\nIn contemporary Latin documents, his name is usually Rodulfus, from the Germanic roots hruod, \"fame, glory\", and wulf, \"wolf\". Rodulf and Rudolf are variants of this name; the French form is Rodolphe. By contrast, the king is normally known as Raoul in modern French, a name which derives from Radulfus, from Germanic rad, \"counsel\", and wulf (whence Ralph). Although this name is of different origin, it was sometimes used interchangeably by contemporaries with Rodulfus. The king himself, however, always used Rodulfus, as on his personal seal.[1] Nonetheless, he is sometimes called Ralph (from Raoul) or Radulf in English.\\nRudolph was born around 890, the son of  Richard, Duke of Burgundy, and Adelaide of Auxerre.[2] He inherited the Duchy of Burgundy from his father in 921 and married Emma, daughter of King Robert I of France.[2] He was elected to succeed his father-in-law,[3] who was killed at the Battle of Soissons against the deposed King Charles the Simple.[4] He was crowned by Walter, the archbishop of Sens, at Saint-Médard de Soissons on 13 July 923.[3] On assuming the crown he passed the Duchy of Burgundy to his younger brother, Hugh the Black.\\nRudolph\\'s first act was to lead an army against the king of East Francia Henry the Fowler, who had made a pact with King Robert I at Jülich earlier in the year. After trying to annex Lotharingia Henry met Rudolph with a considerably-sized army and made peace again. However, in 925 Henry attacked Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine, and took over Lotharingia permanently, Rudolph being in no position to resist.\\nIn 924 Vikings made a fresh series of raids into West Francia. From the Loire Valley they threatened Hugh the Great, brother of Queen Emma, but Rudolph did nothing. They attacked Burgundy, the domain of Rudolph\\'s brother, but were repulsed, and moved on to Melun, where they threatened the royal lands. Joined only by his ecclesiastic vassals and Herbert, Rudolph recruited troops in Burgundy, while Hugh the Great was convinced to join him. After the Vikings left, the Normans, whom Charles the Simple had settled in Duchy of Normandy in 911, began ravaging that whole region. Herbert and Arnulf I of Flanders joined Rudolph and together they took Eu, but were ambushed near Fauquembergues where the king was wounded, the count of Ponthieu killed, and many Normans left dead on the field.\\nAlso in that year, Rudolph conversed with Louis the Blind, king of Provence, over the Magyars, the newest barbarian migrants to Europe, then menacing Louis. In 930 Magyars invaded the region around Rheims, but left before the king could engage them. In 935 Magyars invaded Burgundy and Rudolph brought a large army against them, causing their retreat without a battle. West Francia was temporarily safe from both Vikings and Magyars at Rudolph\\'s death.\\nIn order to increase his own power, Herbert II of Vermandois used his royal prisoner as a bargaining tool to secure the Archbishopric of Rheims for his son Hugh in 925 and the County of Laon for his son Odo in 927. The complaints from Rudolph led Herbert II to bring Charles before William Longsword, the count of Rouen, for homage and then to Rheims to press Charles\\' claim on Pope John X. In 928 Herbert II finally got possession of Laon, but the next year Charles died at Péronne and Herbert II lost his leverage against Rudolph.\\nAfter defeating Vikings of the Limousin, Rudolph received the allegiance of the Aquitainians and homage from William Longsword, to whom he granted in 933 the islands off the coast of Normandy, now referred to as the Channel Islands.[5]\\nIn 929 Rudolph attempted to reduce the power of Duke Ebalus of Aquitaine. He withdrew from him access to Berry, and in 932 granted the title of prince of Gothia to the count of Toulouse, Raymond Pons, and his brother of Rouergue, Ermengol. He also transferred the County of Auvergne to Raymond. Moreover, the territory of the march which was under the control of the lord of Charroux was transformed into an independent county. Later, however, Rudolph was campaigning with Ebalus in the south to eradicate the last Viking strongholds there. He then proceeded aggressively against Herbert II, marching into Rheims and replacing Hugh with Artald in 931. Then, joined by Hugh the Great, Rudolph burned Herbert\\'s fortresses and cornered him in Château-Thierry, where he had first imprisoned Charles, from 933 to 934. The two made peace in 935 and Rudolph fell ill, dying a few months later on 14 or 15 January 936.\\nFor the Australian writer, Margaret Geddes, see Margaret Geddes.\\nMargaret Geddes (7 November 1914 – 1998) was a British oil painter of landscapes and figure subjects who later developed an abstract style.\\nGeddes was born in Cheam in Surrey and attended school in Eastbourne.[1] She studied at the Westminster School of Art in London, where she was taught by both Walter Bayes and Mark Gertler, from 1930 to 1936.[2][3] Geddes began exhibiting in group shows while still a student and in 1938 was elected to the National Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers.[2][4]\\nDuring World War II Geddes worked as a draughtswoman in the Fire Service Department of the Home Office.[4] After the war, she resumed her exhibition career, showing regularly with the London Group, the New English Art Club, the Society of Women Artists and at the Royal Academy.[2] The Leicester Galleries and the Redfern Gallery also displayed her work.[4] Her first solo exhibition was hosted by the Artists\\' International Association in 1950.[1] Further solo exhibitions at the Halesworth Gallery in Suffolk and at Teddington in 1973 followed.[1] From 1951 to 1955 Geddes served as the chairperson of the Women\\'s International Art Club.[4]\\nOver time, Geddes\\'s painting moved from figuration to abstraction.[5] In 1996 Geddes, with Alzheimer\\'s Disease retired to a nursing home.

Rabies medication is also very expensive for the average Tanzanian.[1]\\nRabies is a fatal, preventable zoonosis that infects the central nervous system of mammals, caused by the lyssavirus.[2] It is endemic in low income countries, causing an estimated 55,000 human deaths each year with over 98% of these deaths following bites from rabid dogs.[3]\\nCleaveland et al. (2002) estimated Tanzanian human rabies mortality at 1499 deaths per year, including unreported cases. There were only 193 reported cases, or 12% of the true number of people dying of rabies annually.[4][needs update]\\nThere have been some efforts to control rabies through vaccination of the disease sources, which include dogs and other wildlife.[5] A study done in two districts of Ngorongoro and Serengeti studied the spread pattern of rabies where wildlife plays a role in disease transmission. Findings indicated that an annual dog vaccination campaign, achieving the WHO-recommended target of 70% coverage, would have a high chance of controlling rabies in Ngorongoro and Serengeti.[citation needed]\\nVisočka is a village in the municipality of Sjenica, Serbia.

Upon the journalist commenting that he seemed unexcited, Lincoln replied: \"young man, I have lived for seventy-five years and I have learned to take things as they come\". He did however seem disappointed to hear there was little else to inherit apart from the peerage itself.[3]\\nThe Australian press was much more excited by the news, and three camera crews appeared outside the new peer\\'s flat at Elanora Villas, Bunbury, Western Australia, before more reporters arrived by helicopter. Soon after inheriting the Earldom, the new Lord Lincoln travelled to England, where he was warmly received by (among others) leading citizens of the City of Lincoln. The story was soon fictionalized as a storyline in the Australian soap opera Neighbours.[3]\\nHe later wrote an autobiography called Memoirs of an Embryo Earl, published in 1992,[citation needed] and set about putting on record his formal right to the peerage with a view to taking his seat in the House of Lords. After being briefed on the workings of the Upper House by Lord Deedes, and having been received at the College of Arms, Lincoln stated his intention of joining the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. However, there were delays in the process of claiming his seat, which was defeated by the reforms of the upper house in the House of Lords Act 1999.[3] Lincoln thereafter had no automatic right to sit in the Lords, as all but 92 hereditary peers had been removed. His grandson, the 19th Earl, was later courted by New Labour.\\nLord Lincoln died in Western Australia on 7 July 2001.[4]\\nIn 1940, Fiennes-Clinton married Leila Ruth Fitzpatrick, née Millen, and they had two children, Patricia Ruth Fiennes-Clinton (born 1 February 1941, now Lady Patricia Elrick), and Edward Gordon Fiennes-Clinton (1943–99; styled Lord Fynes, by courtesy).[4]\\nAfter his first wife died on 19 July 1947, Fiennes-Clinton on 3 December 1953 married Linda Alice, daughter of Rev Charles Creed and widow of James Anthony O\\'Brien; they had no children.[4][5]\\nWhen his 10th cousin, the 10th and last Duke of Newcastle, died on Christmas Day 1988, Fiennes-Clinton succeeded to His Grace\\'s subsidiary title of Earl of Lincoln. His ancestor, Sir Henry Clinton, of Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, was the 2nd Earl of Lincoln\\'s elder son by his second marriage; the 2nd Earl\\'s eldest son\\'s descendants went on to become Dukes of Newcastle.[5]\\nThe family has served in public life since the 1st Baron Clinton was summoned to Parliament in 1299, and in the 18th century Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle twice-served as Prime Minister.[6] The peerage of Baron Clinton, created by writ of summons, to which all descendants are in remainder, is now held by another distant branch of the Clinton family.[7]\\nLord Lincoln\\'s grandson Robert Edward Fiennes-Clinton (born 19 June 1972) is the 19th and present earl,[5] a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, who lives in Perth.[8][4]\\n\\nPygmaeconus wallacei is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.[1]\\nLike all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous.

He was introduced in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as an old friend of Han Solo and the administrator of the floating Cloud City on the gas planet Bespin. Prior to the events of the film, Lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, and businessman, and was the owner of the Millennium Falcon until losing the ship to Han in a bet. In the film, when Cloud City is threatened by the Galactic Empire, Lando reluctantly betrays Han to Darth Vader, but later redeems himself by helping Han\\'s friends escape from the Empire. In Return of the Jedi (1983), after becoming a general in the Rebel Alliance, Lando helps rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt and leads the attack on the second Death Star.\\nLando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy, as well as the sequel film The Rise of Skywalker (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.[3] Donald Glover portrayed a younger version of the character in the standalone film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), which depicts the beginnings of his friendship with Han.[4] Lando also appears frequently in the Star Wars Expanded Universe of novels, comic books and video games, including a series of novels focused on him.\\nThe character has become one of the franchise\\'s most popular, with Billy Dee Williams\\' performance receiving praise. Donald Glover\\'s performance in Solo was also well received, being hailed as one of the film\\'s highlights. Williams was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor twice for his performances in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.\\nLando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019), and by Donald Glover in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).\\nLando Calrissian first appears in The Empire Strikes Back as the administrator of Cloud City, an old friend of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and the previous owner of Han\\'s ship, the Millennium Falcon. When Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) arrive at Cloud City, Lando welcomes them as guests of honor - only to betray them to Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Lando had reluctantly agreed to betray Han and company after Vader threatened to put Cloud City under the Galactic Empire\\'s control if he refused. Lando allows Vader to freeze Han in carbonite and give him to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch); when Vader takes Leia and Chewbacca prisoner, however, Lando\\'s conscience gets the better of him, and in the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City he helps them escape in the Falcon. He later assists in rescuing Luke from the underside of Cloud City. Afterwards, he promises to help find Han.\\nIn Return of the Jedi, Lando goes undercover to help Luke rescue Han from crime lord Jabba the Hutt. During a battle with Jabba\\'s thugs, Han saves Lando from being devoured by the Sarlacc; Lando then helps Han and the others destroy Jabba\\'s barge. For his heroics, he is made a general in the Rebel Alliance. Lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, and leads the attack on the second Death Star. He leads the Rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. He then joins the other Rebels on Endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire.\\nLando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens (2015). According to Williams, the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline.[5] His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans.[6]\\nLando was also absent from The Last Jedi (2017).[7] During the early development of the film, director Rian Johnson briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that Resistance members Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight, but Lando was finally written out of the film\\'s script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to Benicio del Toro\\'s character DJ.[8]\\nLando finally reappeared in 2019\\'s The Rise of Skywalker, marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.[3] In the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War, Lando attempted to start a family, and had a daughter, who was kidnapped by unknown culprits when she was two years old. In time, it became clear that the First Order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders.[citation needed] After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force, Lando settled on the desert planet of Pasaana and adopted a life of solitude.\\nLando first appears in The Rise of Skywalker on Pasaana, guiding Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn, and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the Sith wayfinder. Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance, but Lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to Leia. Lando reappears much later in the film, upon Leia\\'s death, and he tells a grieving Poe that he, Luke, Leia, and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces, including the Final Order, with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance\\'s cause to help in the final battle. Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, Lando, Chewbacca, and Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) arrive in the Millennium Falcon alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. At the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance\\'s victory against Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and the Sith Eternal, Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together.\\nDonald Glover portrays a young Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star Wars Story, which takes place roughly thirteen years before The Empire Strikes Back.[4][9] Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input. \"He said, \\'Just be charming\\'. Which is the best advice.\"[10] Williams had expressed interest in making a cameo appearance (though likely as another character) in the film, but he did not ultimately appear.[11]\\nIn the film, Lando is introduced as a gambler and \"retired\" smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han (Alden Ehrenreich) and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. Han tries to win the ship (the Millennium Falcon) from him in a game of sabacc, but Lando cheats and cleans Han out. However, Lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. During the heist and subsequent escape, Lando is injured and his droid co-pilot L3-37 is irreparably damaged, but Han brings the Falcon to safety with help from L3\\'s navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship\\'s computer. Lando later takes the Falcon and abandons the team, but Han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card Lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat.\\nKathleen Kennedy said, in a statement, that a film focusing on Lando Calrissian could happen, but it would not be a priority at the time.[12]\\nBilly Dee Williams returned to the role in the Star Wars Rebels episodes \"Idiot\\'s Array\" and \"The Siege of Lothal\".[13]\\nIn \"Idiot\\'s Array\", Lando wins Chopper (voiced by Dave Filoni), the repair droid of the crew of the Ghost, in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. The crew become Lando\\'s reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss Azmorigan (voiced by James Hong). In \"The Siege of Lothal\", the crew of the Ghost approach Lando for help in getting off of Lothal, which is under Imperial occupation. He is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by series protagonist Ezra Bridger (voiced by Taylor Gray).\\nLucasfilm is developing Lando, a series centering on the character for Disney+, with a story by Justin Simien.[14] It has not been confirmed who will be portraying Lando.\\nBilly Dee Williams reprises his role as Lando Calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in Star Wars Battlefront and Battlefront II.[15] Only the second game narrates a continuous story.\\nLando Calrissian is the lead character in Marvel Comics\\' Lando (2015),[15] a five-issue miniseries set shortly before the original Star Wars trilogy. Lando has a brief appearance in Marvel\\'s comic miniseries Shattered Empire (2015), set after Return of the Jedi. Lando is also the lead character in the comic Lando: Double or Nothing (2018), a five-issue miniseries set just before Solo: A Star Wars Story.\\nThe 2020 relaunch of Marvel\\'s Star Wars series, picking up at the tail end of The Empire Strikes Back, reveals that Lando returns to Cloud City to retrieve Lobot and help Luke look for his lightsaber.\\nThe novel Star Wars: Last Shot reveals that between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, Lando is considering settling down with a Twi\\'lek girlfriend.[16]\\nLegends novels, comics, and video games are not considered canonical to the films. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.[17][18][19]\\nThe Star Wars comic book series released by Marvel Comics featured Lando as a prominent character following The Empire Strikes Back. In the comic series, he has a crime lord nemesis named Drebble, and Lando frequently made use of his foil\\'s name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real Drebble, not Lando himself.[20] This eventually backfires when \"Drebble\\'s\" exploits are recognized by the Rebellion and Lando—being the only person who knows of him—has to present the real Drebble with an award for his own activities.\\nLando is a supporting character in Legends novels that took place after Return of the Jedi commonly depicted Lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including Nomad City in Timothy Zahn\\'s Thrawn trilogy and the Kessel Spice Mines in the works of Kevin J. Anderson. During The Corellian Trilogy, Lando goes on a galaxy-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying Tendra Risant. With his in-laws\\' money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the outer rim planet of Dubrillion. In The New Jedi Order and beyond, Lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the Skywalker/Solo family. In Fury, the seventh novel of the Legacy of the Force series, Lando announces to Han and Leia that he and Tendra are having a child.\\nKevin J. Anderson stated that Lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors in the 1990s.[21]\\nThe Lando Calrissian Adventures is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by L. Neil Smith. Set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the novels chronicle Lando\\'s smuggling days before the events of the original Star Wars trilogy.\\nThe series has been described as \"space pulp\", and highlights the differences between Lando and Han Solo.[22] The books were released in July, October, and December 1983, and were the first Star Wars books released since The Han Solo Adventures (1979–1980); both trilogies were originally published by Del Rey, a division of Ballantine Books. They were also among the last novels in the franchise until Timothy Zahn\\'s Thrawn trilogy was released in the early 1990s.[23]\\nThe series is set 3–2 years before the original Star Wars film,[24] and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the Expanded Universe in Rebel Dawn  (1998), the final book of A.\\xa0C. Crispin\\'s Han Solo Trilogy.\\nFor the duration of the trilogy, Lando is accompanied by a droid named Vuffi Raa.[25] The novelization of Solo: A Star Wars Story makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of Lando\\'s, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical \"Calrissian Chronicles\". He further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures.[26]\\nLando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu is the first novel in Smith\\'s Lando Calrissian trilogy, published by Del Rey on 1 July 1983. It is noted as being more of a psychedelic fantasy novel than hard science fiction.[27]\\nThe book begins shortly after Lando wins the Millennium Falcon in a game of sabacc,[28] as well as a robot which must be picked up in the Rafa system. Upon the planet of Rafa IV, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining \\n\"life-crystals\" which prolong the life of elite citizens. Lando is arrested and brought before the colony\\'s corrupt governor and the sorcerer Rokur Gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary Mindharp of the ancient and long-lost Sharu civilization. The Mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional pyramid with mind-altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring Lando.[27]\\nLando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 October 1983. After selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid Vuffi Raa, Lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. After some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. Fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on Oseon celebrating an event called Flamewind, but is followed by Rokur Gepta. After an explosion rocks the hull of the Falcon, they safely land. During the sabacc game, Lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. He comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. He is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution.\\nLando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka is the third novel, published on 1 December 1983. Nearly a year after Lando and Vuffi Raa have left the Oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter Lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. Able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the ThonBoka nebula. A month later, Lando and Raa receive word that ThonBoka is under attack from the Imperial Centrality Navy. Lehesu\\'s exploration of the Centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. Lando and Raa rush to assist their friend.\\nThe Imperial blockade makes Lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. When the Millennium Falcon strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the Falcon\\'s destruction. Meanwhile, Rokur Gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. Lando and Raa reunite with Lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. The vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the Imperial Navy, which fires on its allied ships. As Vuffi Raa pilots the Falcon, Lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before Raa is resummoned to his original programming.\\nWilliams reprised his role as Lando in Legends videogame Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.\\nIn Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to kiss Leia\\'s hand if she is nearby. Lando is also a playable character in the multiplayer aspect of the 2017 game Star Wars: Battlefront II.\\nDuring development of the character, the original teaser trailer for The Empire Strikes Back introduced him as Landau Calrissian rather than his final name of Lando.\\nActor Yaphet Kotto was an early choice for the role of Lando Calrissian, but chose to appear in the prison drama Brubaker instead.[29] In writing The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars film.[30][31]\\nLando\\'s cane in The Rise of Skywalker was designed to resemble Cloud City. It is inscribed \"Baron Lando Calrissian\".[32]\\nIn 2019, Billy Dee Williams discussed that he built the character around the two features he found interesting; the cape, and the Armenian name \"Calrissian\".[33]\\nIn 2018, The Verge noted that despite Han Solo\\'s first name being written as \"Han\" and franchise creator George Lucas also pronouncing the name as \"Han\" (hæn) off-screen, within the films most characters, including Luke Skywalker, pronounce it as \"Hahn\" (hɑn). The Verge also noted how Billy Dee Williams\\' Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as \"Han\" like Lucas, and that when, in The Empire Strikes Back, Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han, Lando causes most other characters to shift to \"Han\". In Solo: A Star Wars Story, Glover decided to deliberately use \"Han\" instead of \"Hahn\" in order to honor the character\\'s trait.[34]\\nAhead of the release of Solo: A Star Wars Story, co-writer Jonathan Kasdan suggested that Lando is pansexual and stated, \"There\\'s a fluidity to Donald and Billy Dee\\'s [portrayal of Lando\\'s] sexuality ... I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it\\'s time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. He doesn\\'t make any hard and fast rules.\"[35] When asked about a scene where L3-37 jokes about Lando\\'s being flirtatious towards Han, writer Lawrence Kasdan said, \"That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn\\'t.\" When asked about Lando\\'s pansexuality, Donald Glover stated, \"How can you not be pansexual in space? There\\'s so many things to have sex with.\"[35][36] An upcoming Marvel pride-themed series of comic covers is slated to feature Lando, apparently canonizing the character\\'s LGBT status.[36]\\nAuthor Adilufu Nama wrote in 2008 that Lando \"offered a new benchmark in the status of black representation in science fiction cinema\".[37] According to Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post, Lando is a \"fascinating and fraught part of the \\'Star Wars\\' legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction\". She added that \"Lando\\'s the only character in \\'Star Wars\\' with a truly comfortable sense of style.\" On his portrayal, she wrote, \"One of Williams\\'s accomplishments in \\'Empire\\' and \\'Return of the Jedi\\' is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.\"[38]\\nLando Calrissian was chosen as the 11th best Star Wars character by IGN[39] and the 12th best Star Wars hero by IGN\\'s Jesse Schedeen,[40] who also said that he was one of the characters he would most like to see in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.[41]\\nIn 2015, Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando\\'s betrayal of Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back.[42] Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor.[42] Williams wrote that \"Lando is not black or white, he\\'s just Lando. Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.\"[43] He further stated,\\nThe one thing I always find myself explaining is that Lando didn\\'t betray Han and his friends. He was dealing, as best he could, with a situation that was presented to him by the Empire upon their arrival. One of the most amusing moments for me was that Lando decided to challenge Darth Vader (for about three seconds) until he realized that maybe he\\'d better back down and figure out another way to save his friends.[43]Writing for The Verge, Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan\\'s assertion that Lando is pansexual as \"a piss-poor shot at representation\", and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity.[44] Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to J.\\xa0K. Rowling\\'s statement that her character Albus Dumbledore is gay, despite no Harry Potter media depicting this.[44] In 2019, Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well, blaming Solo\\'s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this \"topical\" issue.[45]\\n\\nNephelosia is a monotypic moth genus in the subfamily Arctiinae erected by George Hampson in 1900. Its single species, Nephelosia caecina, was first described by Herbert Druce in 1897. It is found in Guatemala.[1]\\n\\nThis Lithosiini-related article is a stub.

It is known for its historic campus at 1303 Mendon Road, which includes a Gothic Revival style church along with two late 19th-century, clapboard-sheathed, wood-frame structures on the east side of Mendon Road.[2] The church and its accompanying buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as St. Joseph\\'s Church Complex.\\nSt. Joseph\\'s Parish, established in 1872 in an earlier church constructed on the present site, was, at that time, the only Roman Catholic church between Valley Falls and Woonsocket. It served an extensive parish centered on the Irish, and later French Canadian and Italian, mill laborers of nearby Ashton and Berkeley, as an important religious and social center. By 1888, the parish\\'s growth necessitated construction of a new church, which replaced the original, although the rectory and parish hall were retained. According to the State Survey put out by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission in 1998, the present church is one of the finest wooden Late Victorian religious edifices in Rhode Island. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and underwent an extensive and sensitive restoration in 1995.\\nThe handsome, asymmetrical, twin-spired Gothic Revival St. Joseph\\'s Church was designed around 1888-1890 by architect F.E. Page. The building has a tall, end-gable-roof, rectangular mass with a polygonal, hip-roof apse at the northeast end. One-story, shed-roof side aisles continue around the apse as an ambulatory to connect to a projecting, rectangular chapel. The three-story, shorter corner tower has paired lancet windows, battlemented string courses, louver-filled Gothic arches, and is topped by a broach spire. The four-story tower has large, traceried Gothic windows, drip molds, and is surmounted by an octagonal belfry and spire.[2]\\nSt. Joseph\\'s Rectory (c. 1872) is two to three stories in height with a modified cruciform plan. It is a well-preserved example of bracketed style domestic architecture, with a wrap-around veranda and applied ornament of carved brackets and jigsaw work. The interior has been modified.[2]\\nThe relatively plain parish hall (c. 1872) has been removed and a modern structure has been built at the rear of the property.\\n'"

was a military aircraft designer for the douglas aircraft company. heinemann was born in saginaw, michigan. he moved to california as a boy and was raised in los angeles. a self-taught engineer, he joined douglas aircraft as a draftsman in 1926, but was laid off within a year. after stints at international aircraft, moreland aircraft, and the first northrop corporation, heinemann rejoined douglas after it acquired northrop. heinemann became douglas\\'s chief engineer in 1936. he remained with the company through 1960, when he left to join guidance technology. in 1962 he joined general dynamics as corporate vice president of engineering. in this position he oversaw the development of the f-16. he retired in 1973. the famed airplane designer burt rutan would list heinemann as among the leading pioneers in aviation who had inspired him to become an aerospace engineer. his approach to aircraft design was uncomplicated, once saying that he simply took the most powerful engine available and designed the aircraft around it.[citation needed] during his long career at douglas, heinemann designed more than 20 combat aircraft, primarily for the u.s. navy, including many that became legends in aviation history. his designs included the following aircraft: one of the first aircraft to be designed by heinemann was the moreland m-1 trainer of 1929, a braced-wing parasol wing monoplane. due to the 1929 recession only a small number were sold before the company ceased trading in 1933. the naval air systems command awards the edward h. heinemann award annually to an individual or group that makes a significant contribution to aircraft design. siple station was a research station in antarctica (75°55′00″s 83°55′00″w\\ufeff / \\ufeff75.916667°s 83.916667°w\\ufeff / -75.916667; -83.916667), established in 1973 by stanford\\'s star lab, to perform experiments that actively probed the magnetosphere using very low frequency (vlf) waves. its location was selected to be near the earth\\'s south magnetic pole, and the thick ice sheet allowed for a relatively efficient dipole antenna at vlf (very low frequency – 3 khz range) frequencies. john katsufrakis of stanford university was the \"father\" of the station and the vlf experiment sponsored by stanford. there were two stations, siple i and later siple ii, circa 1979, built above the original which was eventually crushed by the ice. the original siple i station had a four-person winter over crew and the later siple ii station had an eight-person winter over crew. the siple ii station used a 300 kw kato square wound generator powered by a caterpillar d353 engine to power the vlf (jupiter) transmitter which transmitted to a receiver in roberval, canada. at the time, the siple ii station had the world\\'s longest dipole antenna. originally 12 miles (19 km) long, it was subsequently increased to 24 miles (39 km) and then a second 24-mile (39 km) antenna running at 90 degrees was added, resulting in a total antenna length of approximately 50 miles and allowing for phased vlf transmissions. utah state also conducted a high-frequency radar experiment for a few years at the siple ii station. the siple ii station\\'s house power was provided by two 110 kw generators (one active, one standby) powered by 3306 caterpillar engines. the siple ii building complex was a metal wonder arch structure approximately 280 ft (85 m) long, 44 ft (13 m) wide and 24 ft (7.3 m) tall. during winter-over operation the facility stored a maximum of approximately 80,000 us gallons (300,000 l; 67,000 imp gal) of dfa (diesel fuel arctic) in three 25,000-us-gallon (95,000 l; 21,000 imp gal) fuel bladders. siple station was named after paul siple, who, as a boy scout, was a member of two byrd expeditions and other antarctic explorations. the station was closed in 1988 following completion of the program. göran \"pisa\" nicklasson (20 august 1942 – 27 january 2018) was a swedish footballer.

cricket club, was an english association football club based in blackburn, lancashire. the club was founded in 1876 and membership was restricted to solicitors, who had contributed 50 guineas through subscriptions by the time the club was entering its second year. the club optimistically entered the fa cup in 1881-82 as one of four sides from the town (the others being blackburn rovers, blackburn olympic, and blackburn park road) to do so, despite not having entered the lancashire senior cup in the competition\\'s two years of existence. the club was drawn to play bootle f.c. in the first round, and took the lead in the first half, but ultimately lost 2-1. both sides had lancashire cup ties on the same day; bootle played theirs against preston north end straight afterwards, while law had to send a reserve team to bolton hornets, which also lost. the same season saw the biggest win credited to law, a 6-0 victory at home to southport; soon afterwards captain rylance moved to southport and essentially took over the town\\'s club. the last reference to a game being played by the club was a 2-2 draw with blackburn zingari in december 1882. for the 1882-83 season the club\\'s opponents were much lower key sides than in previous seasons, and the club lost to teams such as cherry tree f.c. and darwen hibernians. the club had also gone out of the lancashire cup in the first round to farnworth, suggesting that, as some of the better players had moved to more high-profile clubs, there was no longer enough interest in a club with such a narrow constituency, and the club\\'s football association membership lapsed at the end of the 1882-83 season, and was listed as having been a \"loss\" before the start of the next season. harry fecitt, fa cup winner with blackburn rovers, played for the club in 1882 jimmy brown, winner of 3 fa cup winners\\' medals with rovers and future england international ralph rylance, key figure in the history of southport f.c. and

students provided enough staffing to allow for 121 hours a week of programming. in 1971, after experiencing increasing interference on 88.9 mhz, the fcc approved the frequency change to 88.5 mhz. in 1984, transmitter power was increased to 130 watts. the licensee failed to file for license renewal by october 1, 2004 and the station\\'s license expired on february 1, 2005. the fcc approved a special temporary authorization (sta) on october 18, 2005 and the station resumed operation, ceasing again on may 12, 2006 in anticipation of the end of the academic year. the fcc granted a second sta on september 22, 2006 and on january 31, 2007 approved the renewal of the kdic license. the fcc cancelled kdic\\'s license again effective july 15, 2022, as the station had been silent since august 31, 2020. according to campus legend, between the 1950s and 1970s, kgrw committed an fcc violation and was removed from the air for a year after station dj\\'s illegally connected the radio transmitter to metal train tracks on campus, supposedly creating a transmission radius that was hundreds or possibly thousands of miles. according to fcc records, no such violation has ever been documented. sarah jory (born sarah elizabeth jory; 20 november 1969 in reading, berkshire, england) is an english musician and vocalist. sarah jory began to learn to play musical instruments at the

his parents are the artist mary bauermeister and the composer karlheinz stockhausen; the musician markus stockhausen is his half-brother. born in bergisch gladbach, stockhausen received his musical education from his father and various private teachers. he wrote his first compositions as a child and in 1980, he appeared publicly as a synthesizer player in the performance of his father\\'s composition sternklang. in 1981, he performed as soprano saxophonist at the teatro alla scala in the opera donnerstag aus licht. after graduating from the freiherr-vom-stein-schule gymnasium rösrath [de] in 1986, stockhausen gave concerts worldwide with his father\\'s ensemble and was involved in the production and composition of electronic music for two operas from the cycle licht. in 1996 he ended the collaboration with his father. since 1982, he has also worked in various ensembles (including kairos, aparis and possible worlds) with his half-brother markus stockhausen. together with jo thönes, they formed the jazz trio aparis, which gave international concerts and published two cds at ecm. in 1991, simon and markus together composed the piece köln music fantasy for the fifth anniversary of the kölner philharmonie and in 1996, the piece jubilee for the tenth anniversary. after the release of their album nonduality in 2005 the musical paths of the half-brothers separated. since 1991 simon stockhausen has been composing for various german ensembles in the field of contemporary music, including the ensemble modern and the musikfabrik. this was followed by jazz compositions and performances as a keyboardist with lalo schifrin and james morrison, among others, with whom he founded the band on the edge in 2003. since 1998, he has composed numerous incidental music for plays, including for the berliner ensemble, the schauspielhaus dortmund, the staatstheater mainz, the schauspiel frankfurt, the bad hersfelder festspiele, the düsseldorfer and kölner schauspielhaus, as well as the nationaltheater mannheim (drama). he worked with directors such as peter palitzsch, burkhard c. kosminski and andrás fricsay. for the neuköllner oper [de], simon stockhausen composed the music theatre piece rheingold feuerland based on wagner das rheingold to a libretto by bernhard glocks in 2011. in 1999 he founded the group mir with manos tsangaris – for whom he also realised various theatre music as co-composer – in which the cologne percussionist jaki liebezeit was also involved. he has also performed in a wide variety of formations as a keyboardist, live electronic musician and soprano saxophonist, including with vince mendoza, peter erskine, michael riessler, péter eötvös, the wdr big band [de], the sharoun ensemble and the berliner philharmoniker. in 2004, he founded the band royce with christian weidner. stockhausen also composed numerous soundtracks for feature films, documentaries and short films, including the cinema documentary trip to asia [de] – die suche nach dem einklang and feature films by israeli film director amos gitai. stockhausen and an ensemble of musicians put together for the 47th grimme-preis on 1 april 2011, designed the musical supporting programme for the award ceremony. for each of the 16 prizes awarded, stockhausen composed his own music, which referred to the respective prize-winning films. in the 2012/2013 concert season, stockhausen was an artist in residence with the hamburg symphony and premiered a total of five new works, including a major orchestral piece entitled \"doktrin der ruhe\". since 2016, simon has also been working with his mother, the artist mary bauermeister, and composed, among other things, the work farbrausch for the picture series farbrausch, which was performed on various occasions. in his compositional work, simon stockhausen makes use of the latest computer technology. he is particularly interested in the potential musicality of sounds and the exploration of sound in all its dimensions. textures, rhythms and harmonies are derived from noises by sound synthesis and then processed in compositions. through fundamental processes, e.g. time parameters, dynamic changes through compression and the possibility to play back recordings, recorded sounds are changed, i.e. processed. this approach can be described in musicological terms as \"compositional sound synthesis\". he uses found sounds as material to create music in which the boundaries between pop, jazz, electronics and new music dissolve. the preparation of the material with

american christian women\\'s missionary organization. harriet e. giles and sophia b. packard co-founded, in 1877, the woman\\'s american baptist home mission society, supporting missionary women bringing education to the african-american and native american communities. the woman\\'s baptist home mission society (wbhms) was founded in chicago in 1877 to \"promote the christianization of homes by means of missions and mission schools, with special reference to the freed people, the indians and immigrant heathen populations.\" in five years there were 22 workers in seven southern states. moore was the first commissioned missionary. the wbhms would later found the baptist missionary training school in chicago, send teachers to the missionary training department of shaw in raleigh, north carolina, and begin new work with the piute indians in nevada and mono indians in california. the wbhms founded the orphanage at kodiak, alaska, in 1893. on november 14, 1877, over two hundred ladies from boston and vicinity met in the meionaon, tremont temple, boston for the purpose of organizing a woman\\'s home mission society.sophia b. packard presided. much encouragement was given by a woman from maine, who said that the women of her state were ready and waiting to unite with such a society. a constitution was adopted, and officers chosen. the name given was \"woman\\'s american baptist home mission society\" (wabhms). its objects were, \"the evangelization of the women among the freed-people, the indians, the heathen immigrants, and the new settlements of the west.\" laurana b. banvard was made president; mrs. a. j. loud, vice president; mrs. thomas nickerson, corresponding secretary; sophia b. packard, treasurer. an executive committee of twelve was also chosen. mrs. a. p. mason, and mrs. a. pollard were appointed to prepare a paper for the churches, in the interest of the society. later, this committee presented a paper entitled \"an appeal from the woman\\'s baptist home mission to the women of new england\". three thousand of these appeals were printed and circulated, and were also sent to editors of baptist denominational papers throughout new england. dr. a. p. mason also prepared a leaflet showing the need of a woman\\'s home mission society, and 10,000 of these were circulated. the first circle, auxiliary to the society, was formed at jamaica plain; and the first money (us$50), was sent in march, 1878, to aid harriet newell hart in her work among the african american people in a little village in georgia. in march, a committee was appointed to secure an act of incorporation. on may 20, 1878, the society was legally incorporated as the \"woman\\'s american baptist home mission society\". on may 24, mrs. thomas nickerson, who had just returned from the south and west, met the board of directors, and urged the need of pushing forward the home mission work. in june of this year, dr. cutting, corresponding secretary of the american baptist home mission society, met the women of the board and talked with them of the home field, and its urgent need of woman\\'s work. in august, mrs. banvard was appointed to prepare a paper for circulation among churches and associations. a public meeting of the society was held september 18th, in the vestry of tremont temple. in september, packard was elected corresponding secretary in place of mrs. nickerson, whose health compelled her resignation; and mrs. pollard was made treasurer in place of miss packard. the first public meeting outside of boston, was in september, in connection with the state convention, at hyannis, massachusetts. the first annual meeting was at the clarendon street church, boston, november 14, 1878; five teachers were reported in their fields of labor, two were under appointment, and the receipts of the year totaled us$1,533. in 1880, the society sent packard on a trip to assess the living conditions of black people in the south. she visited homes, schools, and churches in richmond, nashville, and new orleans. she returned to boston to report the bleak findings of her southern pilgrimage and proposed a school for women and girls. the society was unwilling to support the idea of a new school, reasoning that the south was too hostile, they did not have the funds, and that packard (age 56) and giles (age 48) were too old. packard sold personal possessions to raise money and planned a school in atlanta near morehouse college, supported by the american baptist home mission society. the women\\'s society reversed its original decision and, in march 1881, commissioned packard and giles as missionaries and teachers to begin a school in atlanta. on april 11, 1881, in the basement of friendship baptist church in atlanta, the atlanta baptist female seminary (now, spelman college) opened with 11 students. within three months, enrollment had grown to 80 and additional teachers were sent by the women\\'s society. the abhms provided a down payment for a new campus, but pressure was exerted by the abhms to merge the men\\'s school with the women\\'s school to create a co-education seminary. the women resisted and, in 1882, had an opportunity to meet with john d. rockefeller at the wilson avenue baptist church in cleveland. laura spelman rockefeller and her sister lucy had been students at oread, 1858–1859, and had met packard and giles on a visit in 1864. packard\\'s vision for the future of the school, financial astuteness, and missionary piety secured assistance from rockefeller. mr. and mrs. rockefeller visited the school in 1884 on the school\\'s third anniversary. the debt on a new campus with five frame buildings, formerly used as a barracks for the union army occupying atlanta, was discharged, and the school was renamed spelman seminary for women and girls in honor of laura rockefeller\\'s parents. packard was treasurer and president of spelman seminary from its charter in 1888 until her death in 1891. there were 464 students and 34 faculty at the time of her death. in 1891, alice blanchard coleman became president of the woman\\'s american baptist home mission society and held that position until april, 1911, when, by the consolidation of the woman\\'s american baptist home mission society, headquarters in boston, and the woman\\'s baptist home mission society, headquarters in chicago, a new national organization was formed having the name of the boston organization but with headquarters in chicago. coleman was the first vice-president of the new organization and president of the new england branch of the woman\\'s american baptist home mission society, the branch being a local organization whose purpose was the holding of inspirational meetings and otherwise fostering the work of the woman\\'s american baptist home mission society. in 1955, the wabhms merged with the american baptist home mission society of the american baptist churches usa. general artur ivens ferraz (portuguese pronunciation: [ɐɾˈtuɾ ˈajvɐ̃ʃ fɨˈʁaʃ]; 1 december 1870, in lisbon – 16 january 1933, in lisbon), was a portuguese military officer and politician.

sulfate process, which achieve similar net conversions. with the idealized formula fetio3, ilmenite contains 55-65% titanium dioxide, the rest being iron oxide. the becher process, like other beneficiation processes, aims to remove iron. the becher process exploits the conversion of the ferrous iron (feo) to ferric iron (fe2o3). this technology was developed in the early 1960s in western australia by a joint initiative between industry and government. the process was named after robert gordon becher, who while working at the western australian government chemical laboratories (the precursor to chemcentre) invented, developed and introduced the technique to the western australian mineral sands industry. the process was patented in 1961. the becher process is suitable for weathered ilmenite that has low concentrations of chromium and magnesium. there are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmenite: oxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert iron to iron(iii) oxide: this step is suitable for a range of ilmenite-containing feedstocks. reduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (fe2o3.tio2), coal, and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200 °c. the iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite: the \"reduced ilmenite\" is separated from the char prior to the next step. aeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by \"rusting\" it out. this conversion is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% ammonium chloride solution with air being pumped through the tank. the tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate in the form of a slime. the finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile. once the majority of the iron oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5m sulfuric acid. lawrence joseph \"larry\" dwyer (2 february 1884 – august 1964) was an australian rugby union player, a state and national representative fullback who captained the wallabies in 1913. dwyer, a fullback, was born in orange, new south wales. he was schooled at the patrician brothers school in orange but left school at age 12 and worked as a clerk in a solicitor\\'s office while playing rugby for the orange waratahs club. dwyer first came to public notice playing for a western districts representative side of country new south wales in 1908. he made his new south wales representative debut in 1910 appearing in two games against a touring all blacks side playing alongside other future wallaby captains in sydney middleton, ward prentice, ted fahey and fred wood. his performances in those matches saw him picked to make his international debut for australia in a test match against those same touring new zealand all blacks in sydney on 25 june 1910. he was picked for all three test matches of the tour and gave an outstanding defensive performance in the 2nd test which australian won 11–0. he made further state appearances for new south wales that year and was selected in a central-western representative side which met a touring american universities team. he was selected in the wallabies squad for the 1912 australia rugby union tour of canada and the usa. the tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two california university sides and three canadian provincial sides. in 1913 he was picked at captain for new south wales and for western districts in matches against the visiting new zealand national side. the pinnacle of dwyer\\'s representative career was in 1913 when he was selected to captain the 1913 australia rugby union tour of new zealand on a tour of new zealand. he played in three tour matches before being injured and consequently missed the first two tests of the tour. he was back for two more tour games and the third test which australia won 16–5. he made three further test appearances in 1914 when new zealand toured australia at the outbreak of world war i. dwyer played thirty-one times for new south wales in a ten-year career that continued until he was thirty-five. he claimed a career total of twenty-four appearances for australia, six as captain. eight of those games were international test caps, one as captain. richard walker barton (july 3, 1799 – january 15, 1860) was a nineteenth-century politician, lawyer and planter from virginia. his nephew robert thomas barton (1842-1917), who unlike three of his brothers survived fighting in the confederate states army, also became a distinguished lawyer in the winchester, virginia area, as well as a member of the virginia house of delegates and author. career u.s. army officer turned controversial confederate engineer seth maxwell barton of fredericksburg was a more distant relative. born at \"shady oak\" farm about six miles from winchester, virginia, to the former martha walker and her husband richard peters barton. his grandfather was rev. thomas barton. when richard was a young boy, his father bought 288 acres of land on opequon creek that included a stone house that local pioneer john hite had built in 1753. the bartons renamed the property \"springdale\" and this man lived there as an adult and conveyed it to one of his brothers in his will. the area comprising both farms was later known as \"bartonsville.\" r.w. barton had four brothers and three sisters. he received a private education appropriate to his class, then studied law. barton married twice. his first wife, the former alcinda gibson of nearby culpeper county, bore two sons and a daughter before her death in 1829. barton remarried, to caroline marx, who bore two sons and two daughters. admitted to the virginia bar, barton began his law practice in winchester, the frederick county seat. he also farmed using enslaved labor, and winchester was also the site of the chancery court for northwestern virginia, which handled cases involving decedents\\' estates and matters involving women and slaves who had no status in the civil court system. in 1830 barton owned 24 slaves, including 9 boys and a girl under 10 years of age, and one enslaved man older than 55. by 1840, he owned 30 slaves and by 1859 his real estate was worth more than $100,000. however, the slave schedules first instituted in the 1850 census show him as owning 28 slaves, ranging from a 100 year old man to 11 children 10 and under. barton enlarged springdale to about 610 acres, and also speculated in land in frederick county and westward in randolph county that became part of the new state of west virginia not long after his death. he helped found the valley agricultural society of frederick county, which began holding an annual cattle show in 1856. frederick county voters first elected barton to represent them, part time, in the virginia general assembly in april 1823, and he was not immediately re-elected after his first term. following the adoption of the new virginia constitution, frederick county was allowed to select three delegates to that body, and barton not only won election in 1832, but won re-election the following year with the most votes of all the candidates, and was the second-highest vote-getter in 1834. he won election to the house of delegates for the last time in 1838. serving for most of 1839. barton ran for a seat in the u.s. house of representatives as the candidate of the new whig party in 1839, but lost to democrat william lucas. two years later, in 1840, he defeated lucas and served as congressman from virginia\\'s 15th congressional district from 1841 to 1843. he did not seek reelection following the redistricting in 1842, which pushed the 15th district further westward, and put frederick county in virginia\\'s 10th congressional district, which re-elected william lucas. barton resumed his legal practice in winchester and other investments. the day following his execution of a last will and testament, barton died on his estate called \"springdale\" near winchester on march 15, 1859. he was interred in the family cemetery on the estate. this article about a member of the united states house of representatives

1917 – june 24, 1929), better known as strongheart, was a male german shepherd who was one of the early canine stars of feature films. born october 1, 1917, etzel von oeringen was a male german shepherd dog bred by a private breeder, robert niedhardt of quedlinburg, germany. etzel was trained in berlin as a police dog and served in the german red cross during world war i. his owner was left in poverty after the war, and was unable to even support the dog. concerned that etzel would end up in less humane hands, he declined larger offers and instead sent the dog to a friend who operated a reputable kennel in white plains, new york. at age three, etzel was brought to the united states to be sold. at the sixth annual show of the shepherd dog club of america, october 15–16, 1920, etzel placed third in his class. he was described as \"immense in body and hind leg formation, in body and legs a trifle better than either of the dogs above him\". etzel was seen by film director laurence trimble, who had owned and guided jean, the vitagraph dog, the first canine movie star in the united states. trimble recognized etzel\\'s potential and persuaded jane murfin, a screenwriter for his films, to buy the dog. a new name, strongheart, was suggested by the publicity department of first national pictures, which released his first film. trimble trained strongheart and directed him in four rugged outdoor adventure films scripted by murfin: the silent call (1921), brawn of the north (1922), the love master (1924) and white fang (1925). strongheart became the first major canine film star, preceding the fame of rin tin tin by two years. strongheart\\'s films did much to encourage the popularity of the german shepherd breed. strongheart and his mate, lady jule, had many offspring and their line survives to this day.[citation needed] in 1929, while being filmed for a movie, strongheart accidentally made contact with a hot studio light and was burned. these burns caused a tumor to form, which ultimately caused his death. strongheart died june 24, 1929, at murfin\\'s home. virtually all of strongheart\\'s films have been lost. : 61 a print of the love master (1924) survives in france, at the national center of cinematography and the moving image. the return of boston blackie (1927) survives from a 16mm print and is available on region-free dvd. strongheart was inducted into the hollywood walk of fame on february 8, 1960. his star is located at 1724 vine street. in the 1926 picture book strongheart; the story of a wonder dog, trimble wrote the story of how strongheart came to the united states and was chosen for motion pictures, of his training, and of his progress in films culminating with white fang. strongheart\\'s popularity inspired doyle packing company to adopt his name and photograph for a canned dog food in 1932. strongheart dog food did a respectable business, especially in the midwest, and was available in stores until at least 2002. j. allen boone wrote two books, letters to strongheart (1939) and kinship with all life (1954), about animal communication and the survival of the dog\\'s soul after death. both books were reprinted many times and remain classics of the spiritualist faith. boone was a washington post correspondent who looked after strongheart for an extended period while murfin and trimble were away on business. boone and strongheart reportedly formed a deep bond, and boone believed the dog was a transformational being. : 62–63 strongheart: the world’s first movie star dog (2014) is a picture book for young audiences by caldecott medal winner emily arnold mccully. the new york times praised her \"meticulous job of recreating the quicksilver world of that bygone media age. the megaphones, bobbed hair and jodhpurs are all here. and in etzel, a dog born and bred to be strong and brave, she has given young readers a rare portrait of a hollywood hero who was just as heroic off-screen as on.\" strongheart:

by the swedish basketball federation. sweden has qualified for the eurobasket ten times throughout their history. their best tournament result was the 11th place finish at the 1995 edition. the scandinavian squad has also qualified for the olympic games once, in 1980, finishing in 10th place. however, sweden still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the fiba world cup. sweden\\'s european basketball championship debut came at eurobasket 1953 in moscow. although the swedes did not fare well in their first tournament appearance. as they lost all seven of their matches to finish in last place in the 17 team tournament. sweden\\'s second appearance on the continental level came at eurobasket 1955 in budapest. the team got off to an demoralizing start by losing to switzerland in their first match. although sweden would achieve their first ever win at the eurobasket against luxembourg in their second match of the preliminary phase. however, they followed it by losing their next two matches in the round as well to romania, and the soviet union. they finished 4th out of the 5 teams in the group with an (1-3) record, and found themselves in the classification rounds. there, the team once again finished with an (1-3) record in their pool, with their only victory coming against denmark. two losses in the classification 13th–16th place semifinals and the 15th/16th place final (a rematch against luxembourg) put sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams. sweden qualified for the eurobasket eight more times with their three best finishes coming in 1969, 1983 and 1995. they also made their lone summer olympics appearance in 1980. but overall the national team has struggled to reach an elite level of consistency to become a serious medal contender at major international tournaments. at some events, however, the team displayed potential. e.g. at the eurobasket 2013 they beat the heavily favored former champion russia 81-62. .mw-parser-output

mcivor, bill and ben hired a plane to fly the message \"mcivor blows goats\" over a new zealand warriors national rugby league game at ericsson stadium. mcivor and the new zealand police expressed their disgust over the message and consequently linehan and boyce received a police warning. linehan and boyce set up their own political party, bill and ben party, a joke political party based on

college football at michigan from 1983 to 1986. he played in the national football league (nfl) for 14 seasons from 1987 to 2000 with his longest tenure as a player with the chicago bears. he served as the head coach of the san diego toreros (2004–2006), the stanford cardinal (2007–2010), and the nfl\\'s san francisco 49ers (2011–2014). in 2015, harbaugh returned to his alma mater: university of michigan. harbaugh was born in toledo, ohio. his father, jack harbaugh, was a football coach, and the family lived in ohio, kentucky, iowa, michigan, and california. he attended high school in ann arbor, michigan and palo alto, california, when his father was an assistant coach at michigan and stanford, respectively. after graduation from high school in palo alto in 1982, harbaugh returned to ann arbor and enrolled at the university of michigan and played quarterback for the wolverines, starting for three seasons. as a fifth-year senior in 1986, he led michigan to the 1987 rose bowl and was a heisman trophy finalist, finishing third. the chicago bears selected harbaugh in the first round of the 1987 nfl draft. he played 14 years as a quarterback in the nfl, with chicago from 1987 to 1993, the indianapolis colts from 1994 to 1997, the baltimore ravens in 1998, and the san diego chargers in 1999 to 2000. he first became a regular starting quarterback in 1990 with chicago. in 1995 with indianapolis, he led the colts to the afc championship game, was selected to the pro bowl and was honored as nfl comeback player of the year. from 1994 to 2001, while still playing in the nfl, harbaugh was an unpaid assistant coach at western kentucky university, where his father jack was head coach. in 2002, he returned to the nfl as the quarterbacks coach for the oakland raiders. harbaugh returned to the college ranks in 2004 as the head coach at the university of san diego. after leading san diego to consecutive pioneer league championships in 2005 and 2006, he moved to stanford in 2007, where he led the cardinal to two bowl berths in four seasons, including a win in the 2011 orange bowl. immediately afterward, harbaugh signed a five-year deal as head coach of the nfl\\'s san francisco 49ers, where he led the team to the nfc championship game in each of his first three seasons after the franchise missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons beforehand. he and his older brother, baltimore ravens coach john harbaugh, became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in nfl history. their teams played in a thanksgiving classic game in 2011 and in super bowl xlvii at the end of the 2012 season. born in toledo, ohio on december 23, 1963, harbaugh is the son of jacqueline m. \"jackie\" (née cipiti) and jack harbaugh. his mother is of half-sicilian and half-polish ancestry and his father is of irish and german ancestry. both jim and his brother john were born in toledo, while his father was an assistant football coach at nearby perrysburg high school in perrysburg. during harbaugh\\'s childhood, the family moved frequently, as his father held assistant coaching positions at morehead state (1967), bowling green (1967–1970), iowa (1971–1973), michigan (1973–1979), stanford (1980–1981), and western michigan (1982–1986). harbaugh played for the junior league ann arbor packers and then for tappan junior high before moving on to pioneer high school. when his father became defensive coordinator at stanford, he transferred to palo alto high school, graduating in 1982. in february 1982, harbaugh committed to play football for bo schembechler\\'s michigan wolverines football team. he came to michigan with a \"high school reputation as a slick california passer.\" as a true freshman in 1982, harbaugh, at age 18, and junior dave hall were backups to quarterback steve smith, who had broken michigan\\'s single season record with 2,335 yards of total offense in 1981. in the 1982 season, smith started all 12 games, and hall handled the limited backup role. even as smith struggled, coach schembechler expressed a reluctance to play harbaugh, saying, \"to suddenly pull some freshman out of the bag, i don\\'t think you can do that in today\\'s football.\" harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the ncaa\\'s redshirt rule. harbaugh performed well in the annual spring game in april 1983, completing 10 of 15 passes for 116 yards. after the game, coach schembechler noted, \"harbaugh is a fresh talent who\\'ll be all right, but he has a lot to learn.\" while harbaugh was touted as the team\\'s \"pass-oriented quarterback of the future,\" he spent the 1983 season as michigan\\'s no. 3 quarterback behind steve smith and dave hall. smith started 11 games, and hall started one game, while harbaugh completed two of five passes for 40 yards in limited action. harbaugh completed his first pass for michigan on november 5, 1983, in a 42–10 victory over purdue. in the spring of 1984, harbaugh was in a three-way competition for michigan\\'s starting quarterback job. three-year starter steve smith had graduated, and his backup, dave hall, was lost to a knee injury. the 1983 competition pitted harbaugh against sophomores chris zurbrugg and russ rein. in april 1984, schembechler said, \"harbaugh is coming along pretty well. he\\'s having a pretty good spring. zurbrugg has emerged as a good prospect. there\\'s kind of a battle in there.\" in the 1984 spring game, harbaugh impressed observers as he completed 17 of 26 passes for 161 yards and an interception. schembechler said after the game, \"we\\'ve been happy with jim all spring. he\\'s shown a lot of maturity.\" after spring practice, schembechler announced his depth chart with harbaugh as his no. 1 quarterback. in his first collegiate start, harbaugh led the wolverines to a 22–14 upset victory over a miami hurricanes team that was led by bernie kosar, had won the 1983 national championship, and was ranked no. 1 in both the ap and upi polls. harbaugh completed 11 of 21 passes for 162 yards and two interceptions. the detroit free press praised harbaugh for \"pinpoint passing\" that \"kept miami\\'s defense on the run.\" in his second start, the wolverines (ranked no. 3) lost to a washington team that finished the season ranked no. 2 in both the ap and upi polls. harbaugh threw a career-high 37 passes in the game, completing 17 passes for 183 yards, three interceptions, and his first collegiate touchdown pass to vince bean. after the loss to washington, harbaugh led michigan to victories over wisconsin (20–14) and indiana (14–6). harbaugh completed 25 of 39 passes for 272 yards in those games. on october 6, 1984, a 19–7 loss to michigan state in the fifth game of the season, harbaugh sustained a badly broken left arm in the third quarter when he dove for a loose ball and collided with spartan linebacker thomas tyree. harbaugh had to be carried from the field on a stretcher and missed the remainder of the season. harbaugh completed 60 of 111 passes for 718 yards, three touchdowns and five interceptions during his shortened 1984 season. by april 1985, harbaugh\\'s arm had healed, and he completed 10 of 16 passes for 146 yards in the annual spring game. harbaugh was the starting quarterback in all 12 games for the 1985 michigan wolverines football team that compiled a 10–1–1 record, outscored opponents 342–98, defeated nebraska in the 1986 fiesta bowl, and finished the season ranked no. 2 in the final ap and upi polls. on october 26, 1985, harbaugh set a school record with 283 passing yards in a 42–15 victory over indiana. after the game, harbaugh was asked for his reaction to setting the school\\'s passing record and responded, \"records are nice, but everything we do here is team oriented. everyone\\'s telling me about the record, but they should tell it to paul jokisch and eric kattus and john kolesar. they caught the passes.\" on november 16, 1985, in a 48–7 victory over minnesota, harbaugh completed 13 of 18 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns. after the game, harbaugh praised the offensive line, noting, \"i\\'ve never had more time to throw in my life—junior high, high school.\" harbaugh\\'s 13 completions against minnesota gave him 123 for the season, breaking the school record of 118 set by steve smith in 1982. on november 23, 1985, harbaugh led michigan to a 27–17 victory over ohio state. in the fourth quarter, harbaugh completed a 77-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver john kolesar, giving michigan a 10-point lead with nine minutes remaining. coach schembechler said after the game that the 77-yard touchdown was \"a play that took the starch right out of their sails.\" columnist mitch albom wrote after the game that harbaugh\\'s pass to kolesar was an image that would last: \"the image that repeats will be that of jim harbaugh dropping back in the fourth quarter and uncorking a soaring spiral that rose high and long as flanker john kolesar ran underneath it, his steps seemingly in sync with the revolutions of the ball, so [that] when it fell, it fell right into his arms, almost gently.\" harbaugh completed 16 of 19 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns. in the final three games of the 1985 regular season, harbaugh completed 41 of 50 passes for 706 yards, nine touchdowns, and no interceptions. for the season as a whole, he completed 145 of 227 passes for 1,976 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions. he also led the nation with a 163.7 passing efficiency rating in 1985. in 1986, his final season at michigan, harbaugh started all 13 games at quarterback for the 1986 michigan wolverines football team that compiled an 11–2 record, lost to arizona state in the 1987 rose bowl, and finished the season ranked no. 8 in the final ap poll and no. 7 in the final upi poll. in the first game of the season, harbaugh led michigan to a 24–23 victory over notre dame. harbaugh completed 15 of 23 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown. in the fourth game of the season, he broke his own michigan school record with 310 passing yards in schembechler\\'s 200th career victory, a 34–17 victory over wisconsin. harbaugh caused controversy when he guaranteed a victory over ohio state in 1986. harbaugh\\'s guarantee proved valid as the wolverines defeated the buckeyes, 26–24. harbaugh completed 19 of 29 passes with two interceptions. for the season, harbaugh completed 180 of 277 passes for 2,729 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. his 2,729 passing

started five games for chicago while mike tomczak started 11 in a 6–10 season for chicago. 1989 was his first season with over 1,000 passing yards, completing 111 of 178 passes in 12 games for 1,204 yards for 5 touchdowns and 9 interceptions and was sacked 18 times for 106 yards. his 62.4% completion rate earned him the team record for single-season completion percentage. in 1990, harbaugh played and started in the first 14 games of the season. chicago improved to 11–5 and won the nfc central division, and harbaugh passed for 2,178 yards with 180 of 312 (57.7%) passes completed for 10

playoffs. harbaugh passed for a career-high 3,121 yards with chicago in 1991 and became the first chicago quarterback since vince evans to start all 16 regular season games. he completed 275 of 478 (57.5%) passes for 15 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, was sacked 24 times (including a franchise-record 9 times on oct 25 against minnesota) for a loss of 163 yards, and rushed 338 yards on 70

the dallas cowboys. the dallas defense overwhelmed him throughout the game, sacking him three times; and in the final drive of the game that started from chicago\\'s 4-yard line with 1:50 left, he threw an interception to bill bates on the fourth play from scrimmage. as of 2017[update], however, his franchise records for completions (22), attempts (44) and yards per game in the 1991 postseason (218) still stood. chicago regressed to a 5–11 record in 1992, and the team fired coach ditka afterwards. harbaugh played all 16 games but started only 13 and had a 5–8 record as starter. he completed 202 of 358 (56.4%) passes for 2,486 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, was sacked 31 times for 167 yards, and rushed 272 yards over 47 carries, including one rushing touchdown. in 1993,

eight games, harbaugh was starter, and coach ted marchibroda re-instated harbaugh as starter for week 15 (december 18) after indianapolis struggled on offense under quarterback don majkowski. in 1995, harbaugh achieved career highs in completion percentage (63.7%), passer rating (100.7), and touchdown passes (17) and led indianapolis to the afc championship game. harbaugh played 15 games in the regular season and started 12, with a 7–5 record as starter for a 9–7 team. harbaugh completed 200 of 314 passes for 2,575 yards and just 5 interceptions with his 17 touchdowns and was sacked 36 times

panthers in the third quarter. indianapolis lost to defending afc champion the san diego chargers in week 16 (december 17) 27–24, with john carney kicking the winning field goal with 3 seconds left after harbaugh\\'s drive with three straight passes had led to cary blanchard\\'s field goal that tied the game at 24 with 48 seconds left. in the regular season finale on december 23, harbaugh\\'s 32nd birthday, indianapolis clinched a playoff berth with a 10–7 win over the new england patriots. completing 20 of 30 passes, he threw for 225 yards and a touchdown. on december 31, 1995, in the afc wild card game against san diego, harbaugh scored on a 3-yard quarterback sneak in the fourth quarter after a 32-yard interception return by jason belser and indianapolis won 35–20. indianapolis won the divisional round game on january 7, 1996 over the kansas city chiefs 10–7, despite only 112 passing yards (with 12 of 27 passes completed, 1 touchdown and 1 interception) from harbaugh. in the afc championship game on january 14, harbaugh completed 21 of 33 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown and rushed 29 yards on 6 carries. but aaron bailey dropped harbaugh\\'s last-second hail mary pass in the endzone, and the pittsburgh steelers won 20–16 and went on to super bowl xxx, which they lost to the dallas cowboys. for the season, he was voted to the pro bowl, was named comeback player of the year and afc player of the year. with new coach lindy infante, indianapolis again finished 9–7 and made the playoffs in 1996 with harbaugh as signal caller. harbaugh played and started in 14 games with a 7–7 record; he completed 232 of 405 (57.3%) passes for 2,630 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, with 36 sacks for 190 yards lost and 192 rushing yards on 48 carries and a touchdown. defending afc champion pittsburgh steelers defeated indianapolis in the wild card round 42–14 as harbaugh completed only 37.5% of his passes (12 of 32) for 134 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception. indianapolis fell to 3–13 in 1997. despite passing for 2,060 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions in 12 games and 189-for-309 (61.2%) passing, harbaugh had a 2–9 record as starter. harbaugh was sacked 41 times for a career-high 256 yards lost. on february 14, 1998, the indianapolis colts traded harbaugh to the baltimore ravens for third-round and fourth-round draft picks in the 1998 nfl draft. with that trade, harbaugh reunited with his former colts coach ted marchibroda. during the 1998 season with baltimore, harbaugh played in 14 games and started 12, with a 5–7 record as starter in a 6–10 season for the ravens. harbaugh completed 164 of 293 (56.0%) passes for 1,839 yards, just his third season with fewer than 2,000 passing yards since 1989. he had 12 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in passing, was sacked 23 times for 145 yards, and rushed 172 yards on 40 carries. the ravens opened a new stadium for 1998, ravens stadium at camden yards (renamed m&t bank stadium in 2003). starting the game in week 1 (september 6) and completing 4 of 7 passes for 33 yards, harbaugh left during the second quarter after injuring a finger, and with backup eric zeier in for harbaugh, baltimore lost to the pittsburgh steelers 20–13. baltimore won its next game 24–10 over the new york jets on september 13; harbaugh started and made 5 of 10 passes for 36 yards but again left early and was replaced by zeier due to injury. coach marchibroda again split quarterbacking duties in the following game on september 20, a 24–10 loss to the jacksonville jaguars, with harbaugh starting and zeier taking over during the second quarter. with 4 of 9 passes completed for 59 yards, harbaugh led a drive for a matt stover first quarter field goal. harbaugh then sat out two games and played as zeier\\'s backup for weeks 7 (october 18) and 8 (october 25). those two games had poor performances: harbaugh completed none of six passes and had one 3-yard rush in the week 6 loss to pittsburgh. despite only 9 of 20 passes completed and two interceptions in the week 7 28–10 loss to the green bay packers, harbaugh made his first passing touchdown as a raven, a 46-yard pass to jermaine lewis in the fourth quarter. in the next game on week 8 (november 1), harbaugh improved in his first full game, with 27 of 34 passes completed over 243 yards for 3 touchdowns and 1 interception and 57 rushing yards in 10 carries. in week 9 (november 8), with baltimore winning 13–10 over the oakland raiders, harbaugh got his first win in a full game started despite passing for only 102 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception. in the final two drives of the game, harbaugh made crucial first-down conversion passes of a 28-yard pass to jermaine lewis and 10- and 11-yard passes to michael jackson. in week 12 (november 29), a 38-31 win over the indianapolis colts, harbaugh had his first interception-free full game, with 16-for-25 passing over 198 yards for 2 touchdowns. it was the colts first trip back to baltimore after the team left it for indianapolis. in an emotional moment, harbaugh presented johnny unitas with the game ball. referee ed hochuli called a controversial unnecessary roughness penalty against joe bowden in baltimore\\'s 16–14 loss to the tennessee oilers for his hit on harbaugh on a 2nd-and-24 play with tennessee leading 14–13 after his 9-yard scramble towards the sideline, ruling that harbaugh was in bounds when hit. on 3rd-and-15 in the next series, however, harbaugh was sacked and baltimore was forced to punt, so the penalty didn\\'t hurt the oilers. harbaugh completed 15 of 28 passes for 214 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and rushed 22 yards over 5 carries. after a three-game losing streak, harbaugh won the final game of the season (and his final game with baltimore) on december 27, 19–10 over the detroit lions with 17 of 26 passes completed for 141 yards and a touchdown. harbaugh played two years with the san diego chargers. in the 1999

15-for-27 passing for 159 yards in a 34–7 win over the cincinnati bengals. however, san diego lost their next game to harbaugh\\'s former team, the indianapolis colts, 27–19. harbaugh completed 15 of 37 passes for 188 yards. with very few seconds left and the ball on the colts\\' 24, harbaugh threw an interception to tyrone poole. harbaugh started the week 4 (october 3) game against the kansas city chiefs completing 6 of 9 passes for 38 yards and an interception before leaving due to a bruised right elbow; he missed the week 5 (october 10) and week 6 (october 17) games because of that injury and two broken ribs. harbaugh returned in week 7 (october 24) in a 31–3 loss to the green bay packers as backup to starter erik kramer; both quarterbacks threw 3 interceptions each. harbaugh next started a game on week 9 (november 7) and completed 25 of 39 passes for 235 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions and rushed 14 yards in 2 carries in a 33–17 loss to defending champion denver broncos. the chargers lost its sixth game in a row after a 4–1 start in week 12 (november 28) to the minnesota vikings 35–27. robert griffith intercepted a harbaugh pass at the vikings\\' 1-yard line with 4:29 left, and minnesota ran out the clock to seal the win. a 12–9 loss to the miami dolphins on december 19 (week 15) disqualified the chargers from the postseason. miami\\'s defense sacked harbaugh five times, and rich owens strip-sacked harbaugh at san diego\\'s 20-yard line. harbaugh finished the game with 20 of 40 passes completed for 178 yards. with 17 seconds left, chris penn caught harbaugh\\'s attempt at a game-winning touchdown pass albeit slightly outside the back of the end zone. john carney missed a game-tying 36-yard field goal. after failing to make a passing touchdown for three games, harbaugh made two passing touchdowns and just one interception on 23-for-36 passing over 325 yards in san diego\\'s 23–20 win over the oakland raiders on the home finale on december 26 (week 16). following an 8–8 season in 1999, san diego finished 1–15 in 2000 with a rotation of ryan leaf, harbaugh, and moses moreno as starters. playing in seven games and starting five, harbaugh completed 123 of 202 (60.9%) passes for 1,416 yards, 8 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, was sacked 14 times for 96 yards, and rushed 24 yards on 16 carries. harbaugh played his first game in week 4 (september 24), a 20–12 loss to the seattle seahawks. on 8-for-14 passing, harbaugh passed for 67 yards and an interception. he became starter in week 5 (october 1). in the 57–31 loss to defending champion st. louis rams, harbaugh was 27-for-40 for 348 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and was sacked 3 times for 15 yards. starting the week 6 (october 8) game, a 21–7 loss the denver broncos, harbaugh was 18-for-43 for 237 yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. two of harbaugh\\'s interceptions led to short denver touchdowns, and harbaugh threw his third interception on fourth-and-goal at denver\\'s 5-yard line. in week 7 (october 15), an overtime 27–24 loss to the buffalo bills, harbaugh\\'s second interception of the game, by henry jones, was in overtime and paved way for steve christie\\'s game-winning field goal. following the game, coach mike riley said he regretted rotating between harbaugh and moses moreno in the first half, as moreno lost two fumbles, one of which buffalo returned for a touchdown. san diego had an espn sunday night football game in week 9 (october 29) following a bye week, lost to the oakland raiders 15–13, and fell to 0–8. san diego took a 13–12 lead with 5:47 left after harbaugh made a 21-yard touchdown pass to freddie jones, but failed the two-point conversion attempt paving the way for the raiders\\' sebastian janikowski to kick the winning field goal with 13 seconds left. in the final play of the game, following a 47-yard kickoff return by ronney jenkins, marquez pope intercepted harbaugh\\'s attempt at a 50-yard hail mary pass that was intended for trevor gaylor in the end zone. in that game, harbaugh completed 25 of 35 passes for 222 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and was sacked 3 times for 27 yards. the following game on november 5 (week 10), san diego lost its ninth straight in a 15–13 loss to the seattle seahawks. in the second quarter, harbaugh lost two fumbles, both of which preceded 10-yard seattle passing touchdowns. having completed 22 of 32 passes for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception, he left the game after the third quarter due to groin and abdomen injuries. harbaugh played what would be his final career game in week 11 (november 12), a 17–7 loss to the miami dolphins. in the final drive of the game he filled in poorly for an injured ryan leaf, completing only 2 of 5 passes for 19 yards and throwing an interception. by that time, coach riley had relegated harbaugh to emergency duty due to injuries including a mild hernia. riley had planned to start harbaugh for the next game on week 12 (november 19), but decided to start leaf instead. harbaugh signed with the detroit lions prior to the 2001 season, where he was expected to back up incumbent starter charlie batch. however, on the eve of the regular season, the lions cut him and traded for ty detmer. he then closed out his nfl career with the carolina panthers in 2001, where he dressed for 6 games but didn\\'t play. the 2001 panthers, like the chargers the year before, finished with a 1–15 record. for his nfl career, harbaugh played in 177 league games with 140 starts. he completed 2,305 of 3,918 passes for 26,288 yards with 129 touchdowns. particularly during his time with indianapolis, such as when he led the colts to come-from-behind wins over the chiefs and chargers in the 1995–96 nfl playoffs and a near upset over the no. 2 afc seed steelers, he earned the nickname \"captain comeback\" (the second player to be so nicknamed after roger staubach) for his ability to win games in the fourth quarter when his team was significantly behind. harbaugh is second in the bears\\' record book for completions with 1,023, while jay cutler holds the record with 1,034. harbaugh also ranks second with 1,759 attempts and third in yards with 11,567. in january 2005, he was inducted into the indianapolis colts ring of honor as one of the most successful and popular players in the club\\'s indianapolis era. during his final eight seasons in the nfl (1994–2001), harbaugh was an ncaa-certified unpaid assistant coach under his father jack harbaugh at western kentucky university (wku). serving as an offensive consultant, he scouted and recruited high school student-athletes throughout several states including florida, indiana and illinois. he was involved in recruiting 17 players on wku\\'s 2002 division i-aa national champion team. his father was a football coach for 18 years, including 14 years as head coach at wku. harbaugh was quarterback coach for the oakland raiders in 2002 and 2003 under bill callahan. during his tenure with the raiders, harbaugh coached starting quarterback rich gannon, who led the raiders\\' run to super bowl xxxvii, won the 2002 ap nfl mvp award, and was selected to the 2003 pro bowl after the 2002 season. other raiders quarterbacks coached by harbaugh include rick mirer, tee martin, marques tuiasosopo, and rob johnson. prior to the 2004 season, harbaugh was named head football coach at the university of san diego. in his first year, he directed the toreros to an overall mark of 7–4, including 5 straight wins to end the season. the following year, the team improved to 11–1 and won the 2005 pioneer football league championship. in 2006, usd again went 11–1, winning their second consecutive pioneer league title in the process. harbaugh was named the head football coach at stanford university in december 2006, replacing walt harris. harbaugh\\'s father, jack, was stanford\\'s defensive coordinator from 1980 to 1981, while harbaugh attended palo alto high school, located directly across the street from stanford stadium. harbaugh stirred some intra-conference controversy in march 2007, when he was quoted as saying rival usc head coach \"pete carroll\\'s only got one more year, though. he\\'ll be there one more year. that\\'s what i\\'ve heard. i heard it inside the staff.\" upon further questions, harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at usc. the comment caused a rebuke from carroll. (in fact, carroll would be at usc for three more years.) at the pacific-10 conference media day on july 26, 2007, harbaugh praised the trojans, stating \"there is no question in my mind that usc is the best team in the country and may be the best team in the history of college football.\" the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. later in the season, stanford defeated #1 usc 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. with usc being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. although stanford lost to usc in 2008, harbaugh and the stanford cardinal upset usc at home again with a score of 55–21 on november 14, 2009. stanford\\'s 55 points was the most ever scored on usc in the trojans\\' history until oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over usc on november 3, 2012. it was pete carroll\\'s first november loss as usc head coach. after an infamous \"what\\'s your deal?\" verbal exchange with carroll following that game, harbaugh and carroll would go on to speak favorably about each other as nfl coaches. harbaugh never lost in usc\\'s home stadium, the los angeles memorial coliseum. in january 2009, harbaugh was confirmed to have been interviewed by the new york jets for the head coach position, although the job was eventually offered to rex ryan. in 2009, the cardinal had a comeback season, finishing the regular season at 8–4, finishing #21 in the polls, and receiving an invitation to play in the 2009 sun bowl, the cardinal\\'s first bowl appearance since 2001. running back toby gerhart was named a heisman trophy finalist, finishing second to mark ingram ii in the closest margin of voting in heisman history. on december 13, 2009, harbaugh was rewarded with a three-year contract extension through the 2014 season. the 2010 season brought more success for harbaugh and the cardinal. the team went 11–1 in the regular season, with their only loss coming from oregon, a team that was undefeated and earned a berth in the bcs national championship game. the first 11 win season in program history earned the cardinal a #4 bcs ranking and a bcs bowl invitation to the orange bowl. stanford defeated virginia tech 40–12 for the cardinal\\'s first bowl win since 1996 and the first bcs bowl victory in program history. second year starting quarterback andrew luck was the runner-up to for the heisman trophy, the second year in a row that the runner-up was from stanford. harbaugh was named the winner of the woody hayes coach of the year award. on january 7, 2011, four days after winning the orange bowl, harbaugh agreed to a five-year, $25 million contract to become the head coach for the san francisco 49ers. he succeeded jim tomsula, who was interim head coach for only the last game of the preceding season after succeeding the fired mike singletary. prior to harbaugh\\'s arrival, the 49ers had not had a winning season nor a playoff appearance since 2002. though the 49ers were expected to struggle in what was anticipated to be a rebuilding season, with a new scheme and many new players as well as shortened summer practices due to the lockout, harbaugh led the team to a 13–3 record in the regular season, winning the nfc west division while finishing second overall in the nfc and bringing the team to the nfc championship game. this was the first time the 49ers had made the playoffs since 2002, generating widespread praise. on november 24, harbaugh played his brother john and the baltimore ravens, losing the thanksgiving showdown 16–6. john and jim harbaugh are the first pair of brothers to serve as nfl head coaches in the same season. harbaugh\\'s work in san francisco had resulted in an extremely successful season, revitalizing the career of quarterback alex smith and with defensive coordinator vic fangio creating one of the leading defensive squads of the 2011 season. the 49ers\\' season ended with a 20–17 loss in overtime to the eventual super bowl champion new york giants in the nfc championship game. at the conclusion of the season, harbaugh was named the ap nfl coach of the year. in the 2012 season, harbaugh resolved a quarterback controversy by replacing incumbent starter alex smith with backup colin kaepernick. smith was ranked third in the nfl in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 19–5–1 as a starter under harbaugh, while kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength. smith began 2012 with a 6–2 record as a starter before suffering a concussion in the following game. he missed the following game, and kaepernick was 16 for 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns in a 32–7 win over the chicago bears. harbaugh was impressed with kaepernick, and said \"we have two quarterbacks that have a hot hand\" while dismissing any rule that a player should not lose their starting job due to an injury. smith was medically cleared to play the day before the next game, but harbaugh chose not to rush him back and again started kaepernick, who threw and ran for a touchdown in a 31–21 win over the new orleans saints. the following week, harbaugh announced that kaepernick would start for the 8–2–1 49ers, while also stating that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent. however, kaepernick remained the starter for the remainder of the season as the 49ers again qualified for the playoffs. harbaugh led the team to an 11–4–1 record in the regular season, winning back to back nfc west titles. harbaugh\\'s quarterback decision was on display in the first game of the playoffs. the 49ers won 45–31 over the green bay packers, as kaepernick had 444 yards of total offense (263 passing, 181 rushing) and four touchdowns. kaepernick set the record for rushing yards by a quarterback in any nfl game with his 181-yard outburst against green bay. on january 20 in the nfc championship game, harbaugh led the 49ers to a 28–24 win over the atlanta falcons, which sent the 49ers to super bowl xlvii, and on february 3, harbaugh faced his older brother, john and the baltimore ravens in the super bowl. it was the first time that the opposing teams\\' head coaches in the super bowl were brothers; the ravens won the game with a score of 34–31 despite a third quarter comeback by the 49ers. in the 2013 season, harbaugh led the 49ers to a 12–4 regular-season record and a third consecutive appearance in both the playoffs and nfc championship game, where they lost to the seattle seahawks 23–17, who went on to win super bowl xlviii. in doing so, harbaugh became the first nfl head coach to reach a conference championship game in each of his first three seasons. the 49ers had an 8–8 season in 2014, failing to reach the playoffs for the first time under the harbaugh era. on october 5, it was rumored that harbaugh would not return in 2015 regardless of that season\\'s outcome, though owner jed york denied the claims at the time. it has been suggested that harbaugh, despite his success on the field, was involved in a power struggle with 49ers general manager trent baalke starting from the 2013 season onward. on december 28, 2014, the 49ers announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways with harbaugh as their head coach. york claims harbaugh and the 49ers agreed to mutually part ways immediately after a win over the arizona cardinals in the final week of the regular season. harbaugh, however, later said: \"i didn\\'t leave the 49ers. i felt like the 49er hierarchy left me.\" he further added that the 49ers informed him that he would no longer be the 49ers coach after suffering a loss on december 14, but that he decided to remain as the team\\'s head coach for the final two games of the season because \"i wanted to finish what i started—what we started.\" harbaugh left the 49ers as one of their most successful head coaches in just four years, as well as becoming the first successful nfl head coach to depart for a college team. new head coach jim tomsula was fired after just one season in which the 49ers finished 5–11. until the 2019 season, in which the 49ers went 13–3 and advanced to super bowl liv, the 49ers had losing seasons every year following harbaugh\\'s departure. on december 30, 2014, harbaugh was

each of his first two seasons as head coach, joining fielding h. yost (1901–02). the regular season finished with a highly anticipated matchup against #2 ohio state, with a likely college football playoff bid on the line. in a game that went to two overtime periods, ohio state finally defeated the wolverines 30–27; harbaugh said afterward he was \"bitterly disappointed with the officiating\", especially for a controversial 4th-and-1 call, and was reprimanded by the big ten with a $10,000 fine. michigan finished the season in the orange bowl, where it lost 33–32 to #10 florida state, after losing heisman-finalist jabrill peppers before the game and losing two-time all-american jake butt early in the game. michigan finished the season 10–3 and another third-place finish in their division. michigan finished the season in the outback bowl, losing 19–26 to south carolina, becoming the only team in the big ten conference to lose its bowl game in the 2017-2018 bowl season and giving them an 8–5 record on the year. michigan began the 2018 season ranked 14 in the ap poll. they lost their first game of the season against no. 12 notre dame 17–24, but rebounded the next two

moving to 4th in both the ap poll and the college football playoff rankings. they would stay at that ranking after a 31–20 win over indiana that earned the wolverines a share of the east division title. michigan lost at #10 ohio state 62–39, denying michigan a chance to play in the big ten championship game. ohio state\\'s 62 points set a record for points against michigan in regulation. harbaugh became the first michigan coach to lose his first four starts against the buckeyes. the wolverines then lost to the florida gators 41–15 in the peach bowl, finishing with another 10–3 season. during harbaugh\\'s fifth season, the wolverines lost to wisconsin 35–14 and to penn state 28–21, both on the road. michigan won decisively against rivals notre dame 45–14 and michigan state 44–10, but concluded the regular season with a loss to then #1-ranked ohio state by a score of 56–27 to end the regular season. when asked about the gap between the two schools, his reply was testy: \"i\\'ll answer your questions, not your insults.\" the wolverines finished the season in the citrus bowl, where they lost to alabama, 35-16. michigan finished the season 9-4 overall. on november 14, michigan

(italian: basilica di san bartolomeo all\\'isola, latin: basilica s. bartholomaei in insula) is a titular minor basilica, located in rome, italy. it was founded in 998 by otto iii, holy roman emperor and contains relics of st. bartholomew the apostle. it is located on tiber island, on the site of the former temple of aesculapius, which had cleansed the island of its former ill-repute among the romans and established its reputation as a hospital, continued under christian auspices today. its cardinal priest has been cardinal blase cupich since 19 november 2016. in roman times, the temple of aesculapius stood on the site of the modern church. the entire isola tiberina had actually been covered in marble in an effort to make the island look like a ship. the prow can still be seen today. emperor otto built this church, which was initially dedicated to his friend adalbert of prague. it was renovated by pope paschal ii in 1113 and again in 1180, after its rededication upon the arrival of the relics of the apostle bartholomew. the relics were sent to rome from benevento, where they had arrived from armenia in 809. the relics are located within an ancient roman porphyry bathtub with lions\\' heads, under the main altar. the marble wellhead bears the figures of the savior, adalbert and bartholomew and otto iii. the church was badly damaged by a flood in 1557 and was reconstructed, with its present baroque façade, in 1624, to designs of orazio torriani. further restorations were undertaken in 1852. the interior of the church preserves fourteen ancient roman columns and two lion supports that date from the earliest reconstruction of the basilica. the inscriptions found in s. bartolomeo, a valuable source illustrating the history of the basilica, have been collected and published by vincenzo forcella. in 2000, san bartolomeo was dedicated by pope john paul ii to the memory of the new martyrs of the 20th and 21st century. in the center of the piazzetta before the church is a four-sided guglia with saints in niches by the sculptor ignazio jacometti, erected here in 1869. the 12th-century tower near the church, the torre dei caetani, is all that remains of the medieval castello erected on the island by the pierleoni. san bartolomeo houses the memorial to new martyrs of the 20th and 21st century, which was dedicated by pope john paul ii in 2000. this memorial is taken care of by the community of sant\\'egidio, who also painted the icon on the main altar. one of the relics that are kept as part of the memorial is the piece of rock that was used in 1984 to kill blessed jerzy popiełuszko. san bartolomeo all\\'isola was established as the titulus (titulus s. bartholomaei in insula) of a cardinal priest by pope leo x on 6 july 1517. the title is held by cardinal blase j. cupich, archbishop of chicago. media related to san bartolomeo all\\'isola at wikimedia commons the 1983 wisconsin badgers football team represented the university of

also used the same title. when a manchu prince had concubines, the status of the wives, from highest to lowest, are the following: difujin (the official wife), cefujin (the first rank concubine), and gege. historically, there were many gege, but few ever ascended to the status of cefujin. a gege could also be a daughter of imperial princess, even if she was promoted to gulun or heshuo princess. only difujin and cefujin names are recorded in the imperial family lists of family members. before the establishment of the qing dynasty, the daughters of khans were referred to as \"gege\" by personal names or the names of lands they lived after the marriage. after 1658, the personal names of imperial princesses were not recorded in imperial genealogy.all the titles for imperial princesses were conferred upon the marriage. sometimes title could be granted before the marriage. the following titles were granted to the princesses born to the emperor: prior to the formalization of rank system, there existed several ranks typical for ming dynasty. the following ranks could be granted solely to emperor\\'s daughter. the prefixes were included in the whole title. however, the title of gege was reserved for several mistresses who died before emperor\\'s coronation and were not granted honorifical names. a gege could also be adopted into the imperial palace and raised by dowager consorts and the empress dowager if the emperor did not have enough daughters. the following titles were granted to princesses born to imperial clansmen: the following stipends were received annually. rarely, but princesses could be awarded a double annual stipend and be treated as imperial consorts, ex: princess hejing of the first rank, who was treated as an imperial noble consort and received a double annual stipend. princesses, who committed a crime, could be stripped of her title and deprived of her stipend. the described garments below were dictated by the \"illustrated precendents for

sister of qianlong emperor\\'s consort shu. during her lifetime, she held a title of first rank mingfu, madam fu zhongyong (傅忠勇夫人). she was described as the most beautiful manchu woman of qing dynasty. she was posthumously honoured as \"fujin\" (title reserved for princesses consorts) as the mother of prince consort fulong\\'an, prince jiayong of the second rank fuk\\'anggan. yu derling

deling\\'s books were published under the name of princess der ling. lawrence leshan (september 8, 1920 – november 9, 2020) was an american psychologist, educator and the author of the best-selling how to meditate (1974) a practical guide to meditation. he authored or co-authored approximately 75 articles in the professional literature and thirteen books on a diverse range of topics including psychotherapy, war, cancer treatment, and mysticism. he also wrote science fiction under the pseudonym edward grendon. leshan received a bachelor degree from the college of william and mary, a masters from university of nebraska and a ph.d. in human development from the university of chicago. he taught at pace college, roosevelt university, and the new school for social research. he worked as a clinical and research psychologist for more than 50 years, including six years as a psychologist in the united states army. he served in the army from 1943 to 1946 and from 1950 to 1952. in the 1960s and 1970s, leshan conducted extensive research in the field of parapsychology. in his book the medium, the mystic, and the physicist: toward a general theory of the paranormal, he investigated paranormal topics, mystical thought and quantum mechanics. in the book leshan claimed to have tested his hypothesis of \"clairvoyant reality\". he said the results were a success and he could heal with mental power and train others to do the same. however, tim healey wrote the results were not convincing as nine of his students had eight attempts at using a clairvoyant training technique and all scored four to fives misses. in world of the paranormal: the next frontier, leshan advanced his paranormal ideas further, claiming that psychic abilities such as clairvoyance, precognition and telepathy can be explained using quantum theory. in the 1980s, leshan\\'s focus shifted to the psychotherapy of cancer support, a field in which he is considered a pioneer. leshan lived in new york city. leshan was married to the late eda leshan, who was also a writer. he died at the age of 100 in 2020. rudolph (french: rodolphe), sometimes called ralph (raoul; c. 890 – 14/15 january 936), was the king of france from 923 until his death in 936. he was elected to succeed his father-in-law, robert i, and spent much of his reign defending his realm from viking raids. in contemporary latin documents, his name is usually rodulfus, from the germanic roots hruod, \"fame, glory\", and wulf, \"wolf\". rodulf and rudolf are variants of this name; the french form is rodolphe. by contrast, the king is normally known as raoul in modern french, a name which derives from radulfus, from germanic rad, \"counsel\", and wulf (whence ralph). although this name is of different origin, it was sometimes used interchangeably by contemporaries with rodulfus. the king himself, however, always used rodulfus, as on his personal seal. nonetheless, he is sometimes called ralph (from raoul) or radulf in english. rudolph was born around 890, the son of richard, duke of burgundy, and adelaide of auxerre. he inherited the duchy of burgundy from his father in 921 and married emma, daughter of king robert i of france. he was elected to succeed his father-in-law, who was killed at the battle of soissons against the deposed king charles the simple. he was crowned by walter, the archbishop of sens, at saint-médard de soissons on 13 july 923. on assuming the crown he passed the duchy of burgundy to his younger brother, hugh the black. rudolph\\'s first act was to lead an army against the king of east francia henry the fowler, who had made a pact with king robert i at jülich earlier in the year. after trying to annex lotharingia henry met rudolph with a considerably-sized army and made peace again. however, in 925 henry attacked gilbert, duke of lorraine, and took over lotharingia permanently, rudolph being in no position to resist. in 924 vikings made a fresh series of raids into west francia. from the loire valley they threatened hugh the great, brother of queen emma, but rudolph did nothing. they attacked burgundy, the domain of rudolph\\'s brother, but were repulsed, and moved on to melun, where they threatened the royal lands. joined only by his ecclesiastic vassals and herbert, rudolph recruited troops in burgundy, while hugh the great was convinced to join him. after the vikings left, the normans, whom charles the simple had settled in duchy of normandy in 911, began ravaging that whole region. herbert and arnulf i of flanders joined rudolph and together they took eu, but were ambushed near fauquembergues where the king was wounded, the count of ponthieu killed, and many normans left dead on the field. also in that year, rudolph conversed with louis the blind, king of provence, over the magyars, the newest barbarian migrants to europe, then menacing louis. in 930 magyars invaded the region around rheims, but left before the king could engage them. in 935 magyars invaded burgundy and rudolph brought a large army against them, causing their retreat without a battle. west francia was temporarily safe from both vikings and magyars at rudolph\\'s death. in order to increase his own power, herbert ii of vermandois used his royal prisoner as a bargaining tool to secure the archbishopric of rheims for his son hugh in 925 and the county of laon for his son odo in 927. the complaints from rudolph led herbert ii to bring charles before william longsword, the count of rouen, for homage and then to rheims to press charles\\' claim on pope john x. in 928 herbert ii finally got possession of laon, but the next year charles died at péronne and herbert ii lost his leverage against rudolph. after defeating vikings of the limousin, rudolph received the allegiance of the aquitainians and homage from william longsword, to whom he granted in 933 the islands off the coast of normandy, now referred to as the channel islands. in 929 rudolph attempted to reduce the power of duke ebalus of aquitaine. he withdrew from him access to berry, and in 932 granted the title of prince of gothia to the count of toulouse, raymond pons, and his brother of rouergue, ermengol. he also transferred the county of auvergne to raymond. moreover, the territory of the march which was under the control of the lord of charroux was transformed into an independent county. later, however, rudolph was campaigning with ebalus in the south to eradicate the last viking strongholds there. he then proceeded aggressively against herbert ii, marching into rheims and replacing hugh with artald in 931. then, joined by hugh the great, rudolph burned herbert\\'s fortresses and cornered him in château-thierry, where he had first imprisoned charles, from 933 to 934. the two made peace in 935 and rudolph fell ill, dying a few months later on 14 or 15 january 936. for the australian writer, margaret geddes, see margaret geddes. margaret geddes (7 november 1914 – 1998) was a british oil painter of landscapes and figure subjects who later developed an abstract style. geddes was born in cheam in surrey and attended school in eastbourne. she studied at the westminster school of art in london, where she was taught by both walter bayes and mark gertler, from 1930 to 1936. geddes began exhibiting in group shows while still a student and in 1938 was elected to the national society of painters, sculptors and gravers. during world war ii geddes worked as a draughtswoman in the fire service department of the home office. after the war, she resumed her exhibition career, showing regularly with the london group, the new english art club, the society of women artists and at the royal academy. the leicester galleries and the redfern gallery also displayed her work. her first solo exhibition was hosted by the artists\\' international association in 1950. further solo exhibitions at the halesworth gallery in suffolk and at teddington in 1973 followed. from 1951 to 1955 geddes served as the chairperson of the women\\'s international art club. over time, geddes\\'s painting moved from figuration to abstraction. in 1996 geddes, with alzheimer\\'s disease retired to a nursing home. retrospectives of her work were held at the woodlands art gallery in london during 1998 and at camden fine art in bath the following year. irkovo

control of infected dogs, and safety inspections in local communities. rabies medication is also very expensive for the average tanzanian. rabies is a fatal, preventable zoonosis that infects the central nervous system of mammals, caused by the lyssavirus. it is endemic in low income countries, causing an estimated 55,000 human deaths each year with over 98% of these deaths following bites from rabid dogs. cleaveland et al. (2002) estimated tanzanian human rabies mortality at 1499 deaths per year, including unreported cases. there were only 193 reported cases, or 12% of the true number of people dying of rabies annually. [needs update] there have been some efforts to control rabies through vaccination of the disease sources, which include dogs and other wildlife. a study done in two districts of ngorongoro and serengeti studied the spread pattern of rabies where wildlife plays a role in disease transmission. findings indicated that an annual dog vaccination campaign, achieving the who-recommended target of 70% coverage, would have a high chance of controlling rabies in ngorongoro and serengeti.[citation needed] visočka is a village in the municipality of sjenica, serbia. according to the 2002 census,

february 1913 – 7 july 2001) was an aristocratic australian engineer, who succeeded to his family\\'s earldom of lincoln (cr. 1572) by primogeniture upon the death in 1988 of his 10th cousin, the last duke of newcastle. born at melbourne, australia, in 1913, he was the elder son of edward henry fiennes-clinton, a mate in the british merchant navy who emigrated to australia in 1912 before serving with the 51st battalion, australian imperial force and being killed in action on 17 august 1916 during the first world war. his mother, edith annie, daughter of captain horace guest, brought him up before remarrying, in 1923, robert johnston lynn, a cousin of deputy speaker of the northern ireland house of commons, sir robert lynn. educated at hale school, an independent anglican boarding school in perth, western australia, fiennes-clinton then worked as a boilermaker, a welder\\'s and machine-minder\\'s assistant as well as a butcher at the kalgoorlie gold mine.[citation needed] fiennes-clinton learned of his succession to the earldom of lincoln during a telephone call from a journalist with the daily telegraph newspaper in london, who began \"lord lincoln, if i may be the first to address you so...\" he said he had known he might one day inherit the title, but had forgotten about it. upon the journalist commenting that he seemed unexcited, lincoln replied: \"young man, i have lived for seventy-five years and i have learned to take things as they come\". he did however seem disappointed to hear there was little else to inherit apart from the peerage itself. the australian press was much more excited by the news, and three camera crews appeared outside the new peer\\'s flat at elanora villas, bunbury, western australia, before more reporters arrived by helicopter. soon after inheriting the earldom, the new lord lincoln travelled to england, where he was warmly received by (among others) leading citizens of the city of lincoln. the story was soon fictionalized as a storyline in the australian soap opera neighbours. he later wrote an autobiography called memoirs of an embryo earl, published in 1992,[citation needed] and set about putting on record his formal right to the peerage with a view to taking his seat in the house of lords. after being briefed on the workings of the upper house by lord deedes, and having been received at the college of arms, lincoln stated his intention of joining the conservative benches in the house of lords. however, there were delays in the process of claiming his seat, which was defeated by the reforms of the upper house in the house of lords act 1999. lincoln thereafter had no automatic right to sit in the lords, as all but 92 hereditary peers had been removed. his grandson, the 19th earl, was later courted by new labour. lord lincoln died in western australia on 7 july 2001. in 1940, fiennes-clinton married leila ruth fitzpatrick, née millen, and they had two children, patricia ruth fiennes-clinton (born 1 february 1941, now lady patricia elrick), and edward gordon fiennes-clinton (1943–99; styled lord fynes, by courtesy). after his first wife died on 19 july 1947, fiennes-clinton on 3 december 1953 married linda alice, daughter of rev charles creed and widow of james anthony o\\'brien; they had no children. when his 10th cousin, the 10th and last duke of newcastle, died on christmas day 1988, fiennes-clinton succeeded to his grace\\'s subsidiary title of earl of lincoln. his ancestor, sir henry clinton, of kirkstead, lincolnshire, was the 2nd earl of lincoln\\'s elder son by his second marriage; the 2nd earl\\'s eldest son\\'s descendants went on to become dukes of newcastle. the family has served in public life since the 1st baron clinton was summoned to parliament in 1299, and in the 18th century thomas pelham-holles, 1st duke of newcastle twice-served as prime minister. the peerage of baron clinton, created by writ of summons, to which all descendants are in remainder, is now held by another distant branch of the clinton family. lord lincoln\\'s grandson robert edward fiennes-clinton (born 19 june 1972) is the 19th and present earl, a fellow of the zoological society of london, who lives in perth. pygmaeconus wallacei is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family conidae, the cone snails and their allies.

landonis balthazar \"lando\" calrissian iii[a] is a fictional character in the star wars franchise. he was introduced in the empire strikes back (1980) as an old friend of han solo and the administrator of the floating cloud city on the gas planet bespin. prior to the events of the film, lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, and businessman, and was the owner of the millennium falcon until losing the ship to han in a bet. in the film, when cloud city is threatened by the galactic empire, lando reluctantly betrays han to darth vader, but later redeems himself by helping han\\'s friends escape from the empire. in return of the jedi (1983), after becoming a general in the rebel alliance, lando helps rescue han from jabba the hutt and leads the attack on the second death star. lando is portrayed by billy dee williams in the original trilogy, as well as the sequel film the rise of skywalker (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in american film history. donald glover portrayed a younger version of the character in the standalone film solo: a star wars story (2018), which depicts the beginnings of his friendship with han. lando also appears frequently in the star wars expanded universe of novels, comic books and video games, including a series of novels focused on him. the character has become one of the franchise\\'s most popular, with billy dee williams\\' performance receiving praise. donald glover\\'s performance in solo was also well received, being hailed as one of the film\\'s highlights. williams was nominated for the saturn award for best supporting actor twice for his performances in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi. lando is portrayed by billy dee williams in the empire strikes back (1980), return of the jedi (1983), and the rise of skywalker (2019), and by donald glover in solo: a star wars story (2018). lando calrissian first appears in the empire strikes back as the administrator of cloud city, an old friend of han solo (harrison ford), and the previous owner of han\\'s ship, the millennium falcon. when han, princess leia (carrie fisher), chewbacca (peter mayhew), and c-3po (anthony daniels) arrive at cloud city, lando welcomes them as guests of honor - only to betray them to darth vader (portrayed by david prowse, voiced by james earl jones), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare luke skywalker (mark hamill). lando had reluctantly agreed to betray han and company after vader threatened to put cloud city under the galactic empire\\'s control if he refused. lando allows vader to freeze han in carbonite and give him to bounty hunter boba fett (jeremy bulloch); when vader takes leia and chewbacca prisoner, however, lando\\'s conscience gets the better of him, and in the ensuing evacuation of cloud city he helps them escape in the falcon. he later assists in rescuing luke from the underside of cloud city. afterwards, he promises to help find han. in return of the jedi, lando goes undercover to help luke rescue han from crime lord jabba the hutt. during a battle with jabba\\'s thugs, han saves lando from being devoured by the sarlacc; lando then helps han and the others destroy jabba\\'s barge. for his heroics, he is made a general in the rebel alliance. lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the millennium falcon, and leads the attack on the second death star. he leads the rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. he then joins the other rebels on endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the empire. lando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, the force awakens (2015). according to williams, the reason lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline. his absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans. lando was also absent from the last jedi (2017). during the early development of the film, director rian johnson briefly considered bringing back lando as the codebreaker that resistance members finn (john boyega) and rose tico (kelly marie tran) seek in the coastal city of canto bight, but lando was finally written out of the film\\'s script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to benicio del toro\\'s character dj. lando finally reappeared in 2019\\'s the rise of skywalker, marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in american film history. in the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the galactic civil war, lando attempted to start a family, and had a daughter, who was kidnapped by unknown culprits when she was two years old. in time, it became clear that the first order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former rebel leaders.[citation needed] after the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with luke skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the force, lando settled on the desert planet of pasaana and adopted a life of solitude. lando first appears in the rise of skywalker on pasaana, guiding rey (daisy ridley), poe dameron (oscar isaac), finn, and chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the sith wayfinder. poe asks lando to aid the resistance, but lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to leia. lando reappears much later in the film, upon leia\\'s death, and he tells a grieving poe that he, luke, leia, and han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. this inspires poe to launch an offensive against the sith eternal forces, including the final order, with lando traveling the galaxy to recruit rebel veterans and other supporters of the resistance\\'s cause to help in the final battle. just as the resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, lando, chewbacca, and wedge antilles (denis lawson) arrive in the millennium falcon alongside a massive fleet of resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. at the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the resistance\\'s victory against palpatine (ian mcdiarmid) and the sith eternal, jannah (naomi ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together. donald glover portrays a young lando calrissian in solo: a star wars story, which takes place roughly thirteen years before the empire strikes back. glover had the opportunity to speak with billy dee williams and seek his input. \"he said, \\'just be charming\\'. which is the best advice.\" williams had expressed interest in making a cameo appearance (though likely as another character) in the film, but he did not ultimately appear. in the film, lando is introduced as a gambler and \"retired\" smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for han (alden ehrenreich) and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. han tries to win the ship (the millennium falcon) from him in a game of sabacc, but lando cheats and cleans han out. however, lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. during the heist and subsequent escape, lando is injured and his droid co-pilot l3-37 is irreparably damaged, but han brings the falcon to safety with help from l3\\'s navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship\\'s computer. lando later takes the falcon and abandons the team, but han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat. kathleen kennedy said, in a statement, that a film focusing on lando calrissian could happen, but it would not be a priority at the time. billy dee williams returned to the role in the star wars rebels episodes \"idiot\\'s array\" and \"the siege of lothal\". in \"idiot\\'s array\", lando wins chopper (voiced by dave filoni), the repair droid of the crew of the ghost, in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. the crew become lando\\'s reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss azmorigan (voiced by james hong). in \"the siege of lothal\", the crew of the ghost approach lando for help in getting off of lothal, which is under imperial occupation. he is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by series protagonist ezra bridger (voiced by taylor gray). lucasfilm is developing lando, a series centering on the character for disney+, with a story by justin simien. it has not been confirmed who will be portraying lando. billy dee williams reprises his role as lando calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in star wars battlefront and battlefront ii. only the second game narrates a continuous story. lando calrissian is the lead character in marvel comics\\' lando (2015), a five-issue miniseries set shortly before the original star wars trilogy. lando has a brief appearance in marvel\\'s comic miniseries shattered empire (2015), set after return of the jedi. lando is also the lead character in the comic lando: double or nothing (2018), a five-issue miniseries set just before solo: a star wars story. the 2020 relaunch of marvel\\'s star wars series, picking up at the tail end of the empire strikes back, reveals that lando returns to cloud city to retrieve lobot and help luke look for his lightsaber. the novel star wars: last shot reveals that between return of the jedi and the force awakens, lando is considering settling down with a twi\\'lek girlfriend. legends novels, comics, and video games are not considered canonical to the films. with the 2012 acquisition of lucasfilm by the walt disney company, most of the licensed star wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film star wars were rebranded as star wars legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in april 2014. the star wars comic book series released by marvel comics featured lando as a prominent character following the empire strikes back. in the comic series, he has a crime lord nemesis named drebble, and lando frequently made use of his foil\\'s name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real drebble, not lando himself. this eventually backfires when \"drebble\\'s\" exploits are recognized by the rebellion and lando—being the only person who knows of him—has to present the real drebble with an award for his own activities. lando is a supporting character in legends novels that took place after return of the jedi commonly depicted lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including nomad city in timothy zahn\\'s thrawn trilogy and the kessel spice mines in the works of kevin j. anderson. during the corellian trilogy, lando goes on a galaxy-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying tendra risant. with his in-laws\\' money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the outer rim planet of dubrillion. in the new jedi order and beyond, lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the skywalker/solo family. in fury, the seventh novel of the legacy of the force series, lando announces to han and leia that he and tendra are having a child. kevin j. anderson stated that lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off lando, noting the character had run his course for expanded universe authors in the 1990s. the lando calrissian adventures is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by l. neil smith. set in the star wars expanded universe, the novels chronicle lando\\'s smuggling days before the events of the original star wars trilogy. the series has been described as \"space pulp\", and highlights the differences between lando and han solo. the books were released in july, october, and december 1983, and were the first star wars books released since the han solo adventures (1979–1980); both trilogies were originally published by del rey, a division of ballantine books. they were also among the last novels in the franchise until timothy zahn\\'s thrawn trilogy was released in the early 1990s. the series is set 3–2 years before the original star wars film, and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the expanded universe in rebel dawn (1998), the final book of a. c. crispin\\'s han solo trilogy. for the duration of the trilogy, lando is accompanied by a droid named vuffi raa. the novelization of solo: a star wars story makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of lando\\'s, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical \"calrissian chronicles\". he further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures. lando calrissian and the mindharp of sharu is the first novel in smith\\'s lando calrissian trilogy, published by del rey on 1 july 1983. it is noted as being more of a psychedelic fantasy novel than hard science fiction. the book begins shortly after lando wins the millennium falcon in a game of sabacc, as well as a robot which must be picked up in the rafa system. upon the planet of rafa iv, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining \"life-crystals\" which prolong the life of elite citizens. lando is arrested and brought before the colony\\'s corrupt governor and the sorcerer rokur gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary mindharp of the ancient and long-lost sharu civilization. the mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional pyramid with mind-altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring lando. lando calrissian and the flamewind of oseon is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 october 1983. after selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid vuffi raa, lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. after some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on oseon celebrating an event called flamewind, but is followed by rokur gepta. after an explosion rocks the hull of the falcon, they safely land. during the sabacc game, lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. he comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. he is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution. lando calrissian and the starcave of thonboka is the third novel, published on 1 december 1983. nearly a year after lando and vuffi raa have left the oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the thonboka nebula. a month later, lando and raa receive word that thonboka is under attack from the imperial centrality navy. lehesu\\'s exploration of the centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. lando and raa rush to assist their friend. the imperial blockade makes lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. when the millennium falcon strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the falcon\\'s destruction. meanwhile, rokur gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. lando and raa reunite with lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. the vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the imperial navy, which fires on its allied ships. as vuffi raa pilots the falcon, lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before raa is resummoned to his original programming. williams reprised his role as lando in legends videogame star wars: jedi knight ii: jedi outcast. in lego star wars: the complete saga, calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to kiss leia\\'s hand if she is nearby. lando is also a playable character in the multiplayer aspect of the 2017 game star wars: battlefront ii. during development of the character, the original teaser trailer for the empire strikes back introduced him as landau calrissian rather than his final name of lando. actor yaphet kotto was an early choice for the role of lando calrissian, but chose to appear in the prison drama brubaker instead. in writing the empire strikes back, lucas initially considered that lando calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the clone wars mentioned in the original star wars film. lando\\'s cane in the rise of skywalker was designed to resemble cloud city. it is inscribed \"baron lando calrissian\". in 2019, billy dee williams discussed that he built the character around the two features he found interesting; the cape, and the armenian name \"calrissian\". in 2018, the verge noted that despite han solo\\'s first name being written as \"han\" and franchise creator george lucas also pronouncing the name as \"han\" (hæn) off-screen, within the films most characters, including luke skywalker, pronounce it as \"hahn\" (hɑn). the verge also noted how billy dee williams\\' lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as \"han\" like lucas, and that when, in the empire strikes back, lando is choked by chewbacca for betraying han, lando causes most other characters to shift to \"han\". in solo: a star wars story, glover decided to deliberately use \"han\" instead of \"hahn\" in order to honor the character\\'s trait. ahead of the release of solo: a star wars story, co-writer jonathan kasdan suggested that lando is pansexual and stated, \"there\\'s a fluidity to donald and billy dee\\'s [portrayal of lando\\'s] sexuality ... i would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly lgbt character into this movie. i think it\\'s time, certainly, for that, and i love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. he doesn\\'t make any hard and fast rules.\" when asked about a scene where l3-37 jokes about lando\\'s being flirtatious towards han, writer lawrence kasdan said, \"that is her personality. maybe it means something, maybe it doesn\\'t.\" when asked about lando\\'s pansexuality, donald glover stated, \"how can you not be pansexual in space? there\\'s so many things to have sex with.\" an upcoming marvel pride-themed series of comic covers is slated to feature lando, apparently canonizing the character\\'s lgbt status. author adilufu nama wrote in 2008 that lando \"offered a new benchmark in the status of black representation in science fiction cinema\". according to alyssa rosenberg of the washington post, lando is a \"fascinating and fraught part of the \\'star wars\\' legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction\". she added that \"lando\\'s the only character in \\'star wars\\' with a truly comfortable sense of style.\" on his portrayal, she wrote, \"one of williams\\'s accomplishments in \\'empire\\' and \\'return of the jedi\\' is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.\" lando calrissian was chosen as the 11th best star wars character by ign and the 12th best star wars hero by ign\\'s jesse schedeen, who also said that he was one of the characters he would most like to see in star wars: the force unleashed. in 2015, billy dee williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by lando\\'s betrayal of han solo in the empire strikes back. williams felt that the situation would have been different if lando had been played by a white actor. williams wrote that \"lando is not black or white, he\\'s just lando. above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.\" he further stated, the one thing i always find myself explaining is that lando didn\\'t betray han and his friends. he was dealing, as best he could, with a situation that was presented to him by the empire upon their arrival. one of the most amusing moments for me was that lando decided to challenge darth vader (for about three seconds) until he realized that maybe he\\'d better back down and figure out another way to save his friends. writing for the verge, megan farokhmanesh criticized jonathan kasdan\\'s assertion that lando is pansexual as \"a piss-poor shot at representation\", and argued that kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity. farokhmanesh compared the assertion to j. k. rowling\\'s statement that her character albus dumbledore is gay, despite no harry potter media depicting this. in 2019, billy dee williams criticized the decision as well, blaming solo\\'s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this \"topical\" issue. nephelosia is a monotypic moth genus in the subfamily arctiinae erected by george hampson in 1900. its single species, nephelosia caecina, was first described by herbert druce in 1897. it is found in guatemala. this lithosiini-related article is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it.st. joseph church is parish of the roman catholic church in cumberland, rhode island within the diocese of providence. it is known for its historic campus at 1303 mendon road, which includes a gothic revival style church along with two late 19th-century, clapboard-sheathed, wood-frame structures on the east side of mendon road. the church and its accompanying buildings were added to the national register of historic places in 1982 as st. joseph\\'s church complex. st. joseph\\'s parish, established in 1872 in an earlier church constructed on the present site, was, at that time, the only roman catholic church between valley falls and woonsocket. it served an extensive parish centered on the irish, and later french canadian and italian, mill laborers of nearby ashton and berkeley, as an important religious and social center. by 1888, the parish\\'s growth necessitated construction of a new church, which replaced the original, although the rectory and parish hall were retained. according to the state survey put out by the rhode island historical preservation and heritage commission in 1998, the present church is one of the finest wooden late victorian religious edifices in rhode island. it was added to the national register of historic places in 1982 and underwent an extensive and sensitive restoration in 1995. the handsome, asymmetrical, twin-spired gothic revival st. joseph\\'s church was designed around 1888-1890 by architect f.e. page. the building has a tall, end-gable-roof, rectangular mass with a polygonal, hip-roof apse at the northeast end. one-story, shed-roof side aisles continue around the apse as an ambulatory to connect to a projecting, rectangular chapel. the three-story, shorter corner tower has paired lancet windows, battlemented string courses, louver-filled gothic arches, and is topped by a broach spire. the four-story tower has large, traceried gothic windows, drip molds, and is surmounted by an octagonal belfry and spire. st. joseph\\'s rectory (c. 1872) is two to three stories in height with a modified cruciform plan. it is a well-preserved example of bracketed style domestic architecture, with a wrap-around veranda and applied ornament of carved brackets and jigsaw work. the interior has been modified. the relatively plain parish hall (c. 1872) has been removed and a modern structure has been built at the rear of the property.
