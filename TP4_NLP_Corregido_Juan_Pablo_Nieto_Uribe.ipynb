              "'Michał Antoni Łempicki  (Russian: Михаил Михайлович Лэмпицкий) (1856-1930) was a mining engineer and entrepreneur. He was a Polish public and political figure, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Empire for the Piotrków Governorate.\\nMichał Łempicki was born on September 14, 1856, near Sztum[verification needed], Russian Empire (in today\\'s Poland).[1] His mother was Izabela, his father, Michał senior (1818-1895), was a nobleman from the province of Płock, then in the Congress Poland. In 1861, he was sentenced to exile to Samara. A year later, his wife Isabella was allowed to join him with their three children, Michał Antoni and his sisters. After a brief release to Saint Petersburg in 1871, the Samara exile resumed till 1886.[2]\\nIn 1874, the young Michał graduated from the Samara gymnasium and moved to Saint Petersburg. From 1874 to 1881, he studied at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute (Russian: Санкт-Петербургский горный институт): he was graduated both from the Institute Natural Sciences department and from the Physics-Mathematics Faculty of Saint Petersburg Imperial University.[3]\\nFrom 1881 onwards, he served in the Mining Department as the head of the Polish mining factories transferred from Warsaw.[3] In 1884, he conducted geological research in the provinces of Kharkiv, Yekaterinoslav and Kursk, with the civil servant rank of Titular advisor (Russian: Титулярный советник). The next year, he became the acting senior clerk of the Salt Division of the Mining Department.[4] As such, Michał Łempicki carried out several works for the Russian Empire:[4]\\nIn 1890, he joined the Polish Mining Plants section of the Mining Department: to this end, he left Saint Petersburg to live in the Dąbrowa Basin on Polish territory. In 1895, he became a member of the Main Mining Directorate (Russian: Главное Горное Управление - ГГУ), offering technical expertise to the mining company \"Граф Ренард\" (\"Count Renard\") in Sosnowica region;[4] there he eventually took over the management of the society till 1901.\\nIn 1896, he founded the company M. Łempicki i Spółka Przedsiębiorstwo Górnicze, Wiertnicze i Hydrologiczne (English: M. Łempicki\\'s Company of \\nMining, Drilling and Hydrology), based in Sosnowiec, Silesia: it operated not only in Silesia, but also in the territory of the Russian partition and in Siberia. The company is still active today under the name G-drilling- United Oilfield Services.[5]\\nDuring the same period, Michał was an active member of various Polish industrial and scientific societies: hence in 1891 he entered the \"Physiographic Commission of the Academy of Arts and Sciences\", which founders originated from the Dąbrowa Basin.[2]\\nFrom 1901 to 1906, he was the managing director of the Joint Stock Company of the Strahovitsky Mining Plants in the Radom Province. In 1906, Łempicki had gathered several positions in the mining business:[6]\\nMichał Łempicki published a number of papers related to mining exploitation. He retired in 1912 with the administrative civilian rank of State councilor.[3]\\nSince 1900, he was the co-owner of a mining and drilling firm M. Łempicki and Co. in the Piotrków Governorate:[6] it carried out large-scale drilling operations in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, notably to build artesian wells. The company, which name changed over the years, had after 1905 many shareholders, in particular engineers from the Dąbrowa Basin (Józef Předpelsky, Anthony Olszewski, Stanislav Sventokhovsky, Edward Poplavsky). Local branches were established in Katowice, Warsaw and Vilnius.[1]\\nŁempicki had also invested in several other business, including the Korwinów ceramic factory near Czestochowa or an agricultural machinery factory in Lublin. The amount of his assets is estimated at 500 000 Imperial rubles.[3]\\nIn November 1905, Michał took part in the Polish delegation appealing to the Prime Minister Sergei Witte. The goal of this petition was to ask for a reconsideration of the policy of the Russian government towards the Kingdom of Poland. He was very active among the Polish community of Saint Petersburg, becoming in March 1906, the Secretary of the Polish Central Election Committee in the Russian capital. As a matter of fact, Łempicki was harassed by the Russian authorities. Indeed in 1907, having failed to be elected to the Second State Duma, Michał was forced to emigrate to Switzerland then Germany. Back to Poland, he continued to administer his mining companies.[3]\\nOn October 20, 1912, he was elected to the fourth convocation of the State Duma, as representative of the Piotrków Governorate. He then joined the \"Koło Polskie\" (English: Polish wheel-Russian: Польское коло), a group of Polish deputies in the State Duma of the Russian Empire. At the Duma, he was a member of the budget commission, the trade and industry commission and the labor commission.[3]\\nOn the eve of the First World War, Łempicki entered the occupied territory of Poland with an Austrian passport. According to Polish sources, he had renounced citizenship, even though he still signed his articles in the Western press as \"Deputy of the Russian State Duma\" (French: \"député a la Douma d\\'Empire\"). With the help of Austria-Hungary, he co-created a League of Polish Sovereignty and became its president.[2]\\nHis actions were utterly condemned by the Russian Duma: on December 12, 1915, he was expelled from the \"Koło Polskie\" for \"anti-Russian activity\".[7] Following the occupation of the Congress Poland by German troops, Michał actively cooperated with the ruling administration: as a consequence, on December 15, 1916, he was deprived of his deputy mandate by a decree of the State Duma, officially for non-attendance at meetings.[3]\\nFrom 1917 to 1919, Łempicki participated to the \"Provisional Council of State\" where he collaborated, inter alia, with Józef Piłsudski, Franciszek Radziwiłł or Władysław Studnicki: he chaired the Department of the Interior, which was responsible for matters related to the organization of local administration, health care and electoral law.[8] Since 1917, he was also a member of the Military Commission established by the Provisional Council of State.[1]\\nAt the restoration of Poland\\'s independence, he was appointed permanent consultant to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. In particular, he was engaged in the work organization in mines and metallurgical plants in Silesia and in the Dąbrowa Basin. He took part in the preparation of the draft law on mining and on the status of the State Geological Institute.[1] Furthermore, he actively participated in the foundation of Polish military formations.\\nIn 1921, Łempicki and his wife moved to Bydgoszcz, where they found here a large group of former inhabitants of the Eastern Borderlands. He knew the city after previous stays at a friend\\'s flat at 23 Chrobrego Street.[2] They lived in the newly built villa at 6 Chopina street. In Bydgoszcz, Michał kept contact with Warsaw institutions, where he liked to visit the Sejm and enter into political discussions with various ministries, having still many friends in this domain. Additionally, he often met with colleagues from the Society of Industrialists and was still a shareholder of many companies. He started to write articles for the daily local journal \"Dziennik Bydgoski\". In the 1920s, he was politically associated with the National Democratic movement.[8]\\nIn his villa, he had gathered a rich library, ornamented with many pictures (mainly portraits of children) by his deceased sister Leokadia Łempicka (1865–1913). He shared his passion of books with a good friend of his, Dr. Władysław Bełza.[8]\\nEven before World War I, Łempicki started to cooperate with newspapers, like the Kurier Warszawski. He co-founded in 1903 the \"Przegląd Górniczo-Hutniczy\",[9] a journal related to questions about mining and metallurgical industry. In Bydgoszcz, he pursued his writings (mainly political and social-oriented) for the \"Dziennik Bydgoski\".[8]\\nHe died on December 29, 1930, at the age of 74. His funeral took place on January 1, 1931: according to his will, there were neither speeches nor wreathes over the grave. Its coffin was placed in the \"Missionary Fathers Church\" in Ossoliński avenue. He was buried in the \"Nowofarny cemetery\" in Bydgoszcz.[10]\\nMichał Łempicki bequeathed all his collections, about 800 volumes and the correspondence of his father Michał, to the city of Bydgoszcz.[11]\\nThe donation comprised books, paintings, letters that his father once received from friends, autographs of Archbishop Zygmunt Feliński, poet Karol Baliński, historian Tadeusz Korzon, Mikhail Bakunin and writer Eliza Orzeszkowa.[12]\\nIn January 1928, on Łempicki\\'s initiative, the \"Łempicki Family Association\" was established. It aimed at providing moral and material support, granting scholarships to young people in education and creating institutions of family and social benefit. Łempicki wanted also this institution to establish sheltering houses in Mazovia and in White and Red Ruthenia.[8]\\nDuring their life, the couple made regular donations to the Kuchnia Kresowa, an association run by Poles from the Eastern Borderlands and providing food for people in the need. Likewise, they supported local orphanage, the Polish Red Cross or the charity actions conducted by the \"Dziennik Bydgoski\".[8]\\nMichał Łempicki was one of the contributors to the construction in Bydgoszcz of the first monument to Henryk Sienkiewicz elevated in Poland. The original statue from 1927 and funded via a local committee composed led by Witold Bełza, was razed down in September 1939.[11] The current monument was made by Horno-Popławski in 1968, is located on the very site of its predecessor, in today\\'s Jan Kochanowski Park.\\nHis wife was Józefa née Biedrzyńska (Russian: Йозефина урождённая Бичинская) from Korwin: they got married on July 23, 1889, in Kielce. She had an artistic penchant[2] At her death, Józefina bequeathed the collections of 48 paintings by Leokadia, Michał\\'s sister: they are now part of the collections of the Regional Museum in Bydgoszcz. The Łempicki family had no children.\\nHis father Michał senior was sentenced two times by the tsarist regime, as an opposent to the Alexander II of Russia influenced by the anarchist theories of Mikhail Bakunin:\\nMichał Łempicki had several siblings: \\nWhile living as a citizen of the Russian Empire, Michał Łempicki received two decorations:\\n\\nIn January, 2008 the BBC reported that Simba Makoni might be nominated to run against Robert Mugabe in the Zimbabwean 2008 presidential election.[1]\\nOn 5 February 2008 Simba Makoni held a press conference in Harare where he stated that he was challenging Robert Mugabe to become the next President of Zimbabwe.[2] Up to that point he had remained a member of the ZANU-PF politburo and the party\\'s Deputy Secretary of Economic Affairs.[3]\\nHe told reporters, flanked by Ibbo Mandaza and Retired Major Kudzai Mbudzi:[4]\\n\"Following very extensive and intensive consultations with party members and activists countrywide, and also with others outside the party, I have accepted the call and hereby advise the people of Zimbabwe that I offer myself as candidate for the office of president...I share the agony and anguish of all citizens over the extreme hardships that we all have endured for nearly 10 years now...I also share the widely held view that these hardships are a result of failure of national leadership and that change at that level is a pre-requisite for change at other levels of national endeavour.\"Makoni said that he would have liked to run as ZANU-PF\\'s candidate, but since he could not, he was running as an independent.[5] He later said that his conclusion that political change was necessary was not the result of a \"St.-Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus awakening. This has been a continuum, incremental, things have been building up.\"[6]\\nRunning under the slogan \"Let\\'s Get Zimbabwe Working Again\", Makoni\\'s theme was Dawn, and this name was given to the organisation supporting his campaign, Mavambo/Kusile/Dawn. He adopted the yellow as his campaign colour. The colour represents gold and the wealth of Zimbabwe, reinforcing his focus on solutions to the current economic crisis. The colour also represents the rising sun and the dawn of a new Zimbabwe, anchored in the hopes and aspirations of Zimbabweans for a brighter future. His campaign logo appeared very similar to that of United States presidential candidate Barack Obama\\'s.\\nJoseph Chinotimba, a notorious war veteran who led the violent invasions of white owned farms in 2000, threatened Makoni with violence following the announcement of his candidature.[7] A leading figure in ZANU-PF, Emmerson Mnangagwa, told ZBC TV that by choosing to stand for a position when the party had already chosen someone to stand for that position, Makoni had expelled himself from the party. The Herald newspaper denounced Makoni as being a pawn of the United Kingdom whose candidacy was being used in hopes of splitting the ZANU-PF vote so that Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could win the election.[8]\\nSpeaking on 7 February, Makoni denied claims that he was a Western pawn or that he was being used by ZANU-PF itself to split the opposition vote. He also said that the ZANU-PF constitution did not provide for self-expulsion and that still considered himself a member of ZANU-PF until and unless he is expelled from the party through due process. Referring to support he claims to have inside ZANU-PF, he urged these supporters to \"remain steadfast and not be intimidated\".[9] ZANU-PF spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira subsequently sought to clarify the matter by saying that Makoni was expelled from the party, in accordance with party rules providing for the expulsion of a member who challenges a designated ZANU-PF candidate in an election, and he said that anyone who supported Makoni would be expelled as well. Morgan Tsvangirai said on 11 February that Makoni was merely \"old wine in a new bottle\" and that he would not ally with Makoni for the election.[10]\\nMugabe spoke about Makoni\\'s candidacy for the first time on 21 February, describing it as \"absolutely disgraceful\", comparing Makoni to a prostitute, and criticizing Makoni for what he considered a self-important attitude.[11][12]\\nOn 15 February, Arthur Mutambara, the leader of another MDC faction not led by Tsvangirai, said that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back Makoni.[13]\\nAt the opening of Makoni\\'s campaign on 29 February, former Interior Minister Dumiso Dabengwa and former Speaker of Parliament Cyril Ndebele were present to support him.[14] Also present at White City hall where Makoni launched his campaign was Edgar Tekere who vowed to de-campaign Mugabe until election time.\\nSimba Makoni received 8.3% of the vote in the first round.[15]\\n\\n\\nWar is an intense armed conflict[a] between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.[2] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.\\nWhile some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature,[3] others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances.[4]\\nThe English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre and werre, from Old French werre (also guerre as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic *werzō \\'mixture, confusion\\'. The word is related to the Old Saxon werran, Old High German werran, and the German verwirren, meaning \"to confuse\", \"to perplex\", and \"to bring into confusion\".[5]\\nThe earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery in Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.[6] Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,[7] military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, \"One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).\"[8] An unfavorable review of this estimate[9] mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: \"In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed \\'approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war\\' to \\'approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&c.\\'\" The lower figure is more plausible,[10] but could still be on the high side considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BC and 2002 AD (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.[11] Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1% of deaths and claimed 400 million victims.[12] Added to the aforementioned  figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.[13]\\nIn War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,[14] and many fought constantly.[15]\\nKeeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.[16] Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.[17]\\nWilliam Rubinstein wrote \"Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...\\'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].\\'\"[18]\\nIn Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.[19] During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the political Left as a force to be reckoned with.[20]\\nIn 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\"[21]\\nMao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if \"half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.\"[22]\\nA distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies.[23] The major exceptions were the Korean War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War, the Gulf War, the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.\\nThe Human Security Report 2005 documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management\\'s \"Peace and Conflict\" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.[24]\\nEntities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.[27]\\nFried defines war aims as \"the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war\".[28]\\nTangible/intangible aims:\\nExplicit/implicit aims:\\nPositive/negative aims:\\nWar aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into \"peace conditions\"[34] – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war.\\nThroughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the Thirty Years\\' War (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as World War I, although it was higher during World War II (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.[37]\\nThe deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85\\xa0million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests[38] at up to 60\\xa0million. As concerns a belligerent\\'s losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.[39] In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth biggest problem (of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years.[40] War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians.[41][42][43] For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6\\xa0million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).[44] Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,[45] and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.[46]\\nThree of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60\\xa0million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.[47]\\nMilitary personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, and death.\\nIn every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.Swank and Marchand\\'s World War II study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.[60]\\nOne-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.[60]\\nBased on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.[61] The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60\\xa0million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I, 8\\xa0million were killed, 7\\xa0million were permanently disabled, and 15\\xa0million were seriously injured.[62]\\nDuring Napoleon\\'s retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians.[63] Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action.[64] In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the Seven Years\\' War, the Royal Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were \\'missing\\'.[65]\\nIt is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war.[66]\\nMost wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine, disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty Years\\' War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent.[67][68] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. Additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking water.[69]\\nMost estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60\\xa0million people died, 40\\xa0million of whom were civilians.[70] Deaths in the Soviet Union were around 27 million.[71] Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.[72]\\nOnce a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.[73]\\nTypically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists[who?] believe war can stimulate a country\\'s economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the Great Depression by most Keynesian economists), but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia\\'s involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.[74]\\nWorld War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).[75][76]\\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.[77]\\nBy the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed.[78] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679\\xa0billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000\\xa0mi (64,374\\xa0km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.[79]\\nThere are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common.[80] Carl von Clausewitz said, \\'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.\\'[81]\\nDutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, \"War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.\"[82]\\nOther psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent.[83] This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.\\nThe Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective \"elaboration\" of mourning.[84] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \"love need\": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.\\nDespite Fornari\\'s theory that man\\'s altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.[85] Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.[86] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.\\nNaturally, the common people don\\'t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.[88]\\nThe latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees,[89] as well as in many ant species,[90] group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.[91]\\nPsychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.[92][failed verification]  He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group\\'s (or an individual\\'s) reputation (\"honor\").[citation needed]\\nCrofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which \"coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups\", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking \"tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors\".[93]\\nAshley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.[94] Montagu\\'s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay peninsula.[95] Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.[96]\\nWar can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity.[97] While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.[98][99] Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.S. Generals, expressed support for an economic view of war.\\nThe Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.[100]\\nDemographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:\\nMalthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.\\nPope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said:\\nFor this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.[101]This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine.[102]\\nThe violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth.[103][104][105]\\nAccording to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the \"fighting age\" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.[106][107]\\nHeinsohn saw both past \"Christianist\" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today\\'s Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.[108] Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789,[109] and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.[110] The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.[111]\\nYouth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank,[112] Population Action International,[113] and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development.[114] Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination.[115]\\nGeoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the \"Western way of war\" based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and—from about 1500 onward—a unique system of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline. [116]Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, \"the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they\\'re attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.\"  Discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small \"artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency.[117]\\nRationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.[118] Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In \"Rationalist Explanations for War\", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:\\n\"Issue indivisibility\" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.\\n\"Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent\" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state\\'s victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, \"war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.\"[119] Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states\\' inability to make credible commitments.[120]\\nWithin the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias,[121] but are still \"as rational as you and me\".[122] According to philosopher Iain King, \"Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....\"[123] King asserts that \"Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in GroupThink\" which is faulty, but still rational.[124]\\nThe rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.[125]\\nThe statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.[citation needed]\\nThe following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often used by political scientists since then.[126]:\\u200a143\\u200a\\nThere are several different international relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma.[126]:\\u200a145\\u200a\\nWithin the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are:\\nThe two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.[126]:\\u200a148\\u200a\\nLiberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists[who?] respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.[126]:\\u200a149\\u200a Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.[126]:\\u200a150\\u200a Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don\\'t necessarily trade less with each other.[126]:\\u200a150\\u200a\\nThese theories suggest differences in people\\'s personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.[126]:\\u200a157\\u200a For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases,[126]:\\u200a157\\u200a such as prospect theory.[128]\\nThe morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.[129]\\nThe two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.[130]\\nJus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.[131][132]\\nJus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.[133] The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.[133] Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.[134]\\n The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in international law\\'s regulations on legitimate war.[129]\\nFascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as Pragmatism, racism, and social Darwinism, hold that violence is good.[136][137] Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the means. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.[138]\\nReligious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: \"Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.\"[139]\\nAnti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States.\\nDuring a war, brief pauses of violence may be called for, and further agreed to— ceasefire, temporary cessation, humanitarian pauses and corridors, days of tranquility, de-confliction arrangements.[140] There a number of disadvantages, obstacles and hesitations against implementing such pauses such as a humanitarian corridor.[141][142] Pauses in conflict are also ill-advised; reasons such as \"delay of defeat\" and the \"weakening of credibility\".[143] Natural causes for a pause may include events such as the 2019 coronavirus pandemic.[144][145]\\nBrian Fleming[1][2] (born October 8, 1971) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known by his ring name Al Katrazz, a word play on the name of Alcatraz Prison and a reference Fleming\\'s gimmick of a convict.\\nAfter completing his training, Fleming debuted in Ultimate Pro Wrestling in a tag team match with Basil in a losing effort to Mike Knox and Samoa Joe at the event Proving Ground on December 12, 2000.[3] Katrazz and Basil, now renamed to Bad Boy Basil, soon became a regular tag team, calling themselves the Definition of Pain, and on February 2, 2001, they were eliminated in a tournament for the vacant the Tag Team title at Warzone after losing to The Ballard Brothers (Shane and Shannon).[3]\\nOn June 26 at Control, Katrazz wrestled his first singles match, which he lost to Adam Pearce.[3] At Unfinished Business on August 22, he lost to Keiji Sakoda.[3] After three victories in a row, Katrazz challenged the Heavyweight Champion Mikey Henderson for the title at Season\\'s Beatings on December 19, but failed to win.[3]\\nOn May 5, 2002, Al Katrazz and Hardkore Kidd started a short feud, which saw Katrazz lose a Falls Count Anywhere match at Gold Rush.[3] The feud culminated after a match at Home Of The Brave II, which Kidd also won.[3] On January 8, 2003, Katrazz and Kidd formed a tag team known as Hardkore Inc., and began pursuing the Tag Team Championship.[4] The team lost to The Ballard Brothers in a title match at Rage On The River: Unleashed on April 19 at the Edgewater Event Center in Laughlin, Nevada.[3] However, they defeated The Ballard Brothers for the championship on April 25 in a tables match at Entertainment Overload.[3] After several title defenses, Hardkore, Inc. lost the title back to The Ballard Brothers at Overload on February 20, 2004 in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.[3]\\nKatrazz left UPW in 2006 in order to participate in the tapings for Wrestling Society X, and he wrestled his last match for UPW on January 1, 2007, which he lost to Human Tornado at the O.C. Dojo event.[5]\\nKatrazz, debuted in the Alternative Wrestling Show on May 31, 2003 in a six-man tag team match, where he reunited with Hardkore Kidd and teamed with Adam Pearce to defeat Babi Slymm, Disco Machine, and Super Dragon.[5] Over the following months, Katrazz was victorious over the likes of Slymm, Dragon, Kenny King, Disco Machine, and Excalibur.\\nOn May 1, 2004, he and Hardkore Kidd reformed Hardkore Inc. and won the Tag Team Championship by defeating Lil Cholo and Scorpio Sky.[5] After Kidd left the ASW, Katrazz selected Adam Pearce as his new tag team partner and they successfully retained the title against Joey Ryan and Scott Lost on May 29.[5] Katrazz then picked Skulu as his second replacement partner, and together they retained the title two months later against Black Metal and King Jakal.[5] At A Major Styles Clash on September 25, Katrazz and Skulu lost the title to Misterioso and Super Boy.[5]\\nIn 2005, Katrazz attempted to reclaim the Tag Team Title with Davey Richards, first unsuccessfully challenging Los Chivos (Enigma de Oro and Kayam) on June 18.[5] They were again unsuccessful after Los Chivo retained their title in a four-way tag team match on July 30 that also involved the teams of Junior and Phoenix Star and Ronin and Top Gun Talwar.[5]\\nAfter losing to the Heavyweight Champion Human Tornado at Turkey Sandwich on November 26 via disqualification, he captured the championship on May 20, 2006 at Mayhem: A Fight For The Belt.[5] He won a 32-Man Bunkhouse Brawl at Bart\\'s Bunkhouse Brawl on July 29 to retain the Heavyweight Title after lasting an hour and four minutes. After losing to Human Tornado via disqualification on September 30 at Prelude To A Slaughterhouse, the Heavyweight Title was vacated on October 1. From June 22 an July 27, 2007, Katrazz competed in a tournament for the vacant Heavyweight Championship. After defeating Enigma de Oro, Apollo Kahn and Peter Goodman in the previous rounds, he defeated former tag team partner Aaron Aguilera at Crowning A Champion to win his second Heavyweight Title.[5] On November 4, he lost the championship to Lil Cholo in a No Disqualification Falls Count Anywhere match before leaving the promotion.[5]\\nKatrazz joined Pro Wrestling Guerrilla in 2003 and reformed Hardkore Inc. alongside The Hardkore Kidd and new allies Adam Pearce and El Jefe.[6] On July 26 at Debut Show, PWG\\'s inaugural event Hardkore, Inc. defeated The X-Foundation (Funky Billy Kim, Joey Ryan and Scott Lost). On August 30 during the second day of the first annual Bad Ass Mother 3000 tournament, Katrazz and Kidd defeated Apollo Kahn and Hook Bomberry. In the first round of the first annual Tango & Cash Invitational, Katrazz and Kidd were eliminated by The Havana Pitbulls (Ricky Reyes and Rocky Romero) on January 24, 2004 in Santa Ana, California. The tournament was held to crown the inaugural Tag Team Champions, which was eventually won by The Strong Style Thugs (B-Boy and Homicide).[1]\\nOn January 21, 2006, Katrazz debuted in the National Wrestling Alliance, where he lost an elimination tag team match along with Adam Pearce, Crayz and The Plague to Aaron Aguilera, Babi Slymm, Human Tornado and Sexy Chino at The Super Bart Shuffle. At Pro Wrestling Summit on September 22 in the Orleans Arena of Las Vegas, Nevada, Katrazz reunited with Aguilera, but lost to Human Tornado and Konnan in a tag team match.[1] Fleming began appearing sporadically for the NWA in 2007, due to concentrating on the Alternative Wrestling Show as well as taping episodes for Wrestling Society X.[1]\\nIn 2006, Fleming took part in the tapings for Wrestling Society X under the ringname Alkatrazz. While in WSX, he formed a tag team with Luke Hawx.[7] The most notable match he had in WSX was a Tables, Ladders & Cervesaz match, which he and Hawx won against Los Pochos Guapos (Aaron Aguilera and Kaos),[5][7] which was taped on November 12.[5][7] WSX folded shortly after its first season of tapings. In 2007, Fleming debuted in SoCal Pro Wrestling and on April 14, he took part in the promotion\\'s debut event, SoCal - The Debut Event, where he lost to Jason Redondo. At SoCal Super Clash on September 15, Katrazz defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Adam Pearce via disqualification. Katrazz then lost to Redondo in a match for the vacant Heavyweight Championship at SoCal Pro 1 Year Anniversary on April 26, 2008.[5]\\nIn 2008, Fleming returned to the NWA and began appearing on their television show, Wrestling Showcase, where he competed as an enhancement talent to other wrestlers in singles and tag team competition.[5]\\nAfter a four-year-long hiatus, Katrazz returned to professional wrestling July 6, 2012 at United Forces 4, a cross-promotional event between Alternative Wrestling Show and Empire Wrestling Federation, where he defeated Johnny Goodtime to win the AWS Heavyweight Championship for the third time.[5] The following night at AWS\\' Ten Year Anniversary event, Katrazz lost the Heavyweight Title to Extreme Loco in a three-way match also involving Biggie Biggz.[5]\\n1After Hardkore Kidd left the Alternative Wrestling Show, Katrazz defended the championship with Adam Pearce and then Skulu.\\n\\nRobin Fior (27 January 1935 – 29 September 2012) was a designer closely associated with radical and libertarian causes in the 1960s and 70s.[1][2][3][4][5]\\nBorn in London, Fior learned typesetting as a public schoolboy at Harrow. As a designer and typographer, he was self-taught, learning on the job and from colleagues and printers. His single year as an undergraduate in the English department at Oxford was spent mostly in bookshops.

It is a Level III tertiary, training and teaching hospital with 250 authorized beds as mandated by Republic Act (R.A.) 6780 enacted in 1990.  The hospital caters to the people of Region III, with the people of Pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Tarlac, Zambales and Aurora as its secondary catchment areas.[1]\\nIn the nearly 100 years of existence of the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital, enormous development had been done in terms of facility improvement, manpower complement and capability enhancement. Indeed, the hospital had come a long way. From its beginning in 1921 from the two (2) hectare lot at Dolores, San Fernando, Pampanga donated by the late Juan Teopaco, it is now regarded as one of the leading referral center in the region.\\nThe JBLMRH started at an eight (8) bed capacity hospital formerly known as Pampanga Provincial Hospital. It was financed and operated by provincial health funds under the management of six pioneering individuals headed by Dr. Lorenzo de Jesus. To satisfy the growing hospital need of the people, various material improvements were introduced in the hospital, thus increasing its bed capacity from eight (8) beds to fifty (50) beds in January 1951. Later in July 1964, the hospital\\'s name changed into Central Luzon General Hospital with the corresponding increase in its bed capacity to one hundred twenty five (125) beds. Dr. Bartolome Vecta was appointed as Chief of Hospital during this time. Further construction of various facilities in the hospital led to the increase in its bed capacity to one hundred fifty (150) in 1972 and again to two hundred beds (200) in 1975. In 1979, Dr. Vecta was replaced by Dr. Ignacio Valencia. During the incumbency of Dr. Valencia, a building that can accommodate one hundred beds was constructed, thus finally increasing the hospital\\'s bed capacity into two hundred fifty (250) beds. Dr. Conrado Mariano took the helm of managing the hospital after Dr. Ignacio Valencia. In March 1988, Dr. Mariano was promoted to Assistant Regional Director at the Regional Health Office No. 3, hence he was replaced by the then Provincial Health Officer of Bataan in the person of Dr. Rogelio Reyes. Dr. Reyes served the hospital for three years until finally in February 1991 he retired to give way to his political ambition.\\nOn November 25, 1989, RA No. 6780 entitled “An Act of Changing the Name of the Central Luzon General Hospital located in the municipality of San Fernando, province of Pampanga, to Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital” was one of the bills signed by the then former President Corazon C. Aquino. It is on this day on that the hospital was recognized as Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital. Dra. Venus Galang, the then Chief of Medical Professional Staff was appointed as Officer-in-Charge in March 1991 to fill-in the position left by Dr. Reyes. During the term of Dra. Galang, the hospital was being awarded for being a Baby Friendly Hospital. In December 1992, Dr. Ladislao Yuchongco was appointed as permanent Chief of Hospital of Jose B.

After his Illinois career came to an end, Kerr started a 12-year professional career followed by becoming the first head coach of the Chicago Bulls in 1966.\\nThe 1954 team added twin brothers, Paul and Phil Judson from Hebron, Illinois, Bruce Brothers and Bill Ridley as sophomores.  A youth movement that helped the Illini finish in a 3rd place tie in the Big Ten. Unfortunately the Illini would lose 5 total games with three of the five losses coming at the hands of ranked opponents.

It generally grows on heavier soils. The cream flowers appear in spring and are fused into compound flowerheads.\\nEnglish botanist James Edward Smith first described the turpentine as Metrosideros glomulifera in 1797, from a collection in the Sydney district.[2] It was given its current binomial name by German botanist Franz Josef Niedenzu in 1893.[3] Common names include turpentine, luster, red turpentine or red luster.[3] It was formerly known as Syncarpia laurifolia Ten.[4] Two subspecies are recognised, the widespread nominate, and subspecies glabra which is found from Bulahdelah north to Kempsey and has smooth leaf undersurfaces.[5]\\nIn a suitable location, the turpentine grows into a large straight-trunked tree up to 45 or even 55\\xa0m (150–180\\xa0ft) high with a DBH of up to 1.3 or even 1.5\\xa0m (4–5\\xa0ft).[5] On poorer soils it grows as a small tree or even adopts a mallee habit.[6] The thick brown bark is fibrous, with deep vertical furrows running down the trunk. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and pairs grow close together so that they resemble a whorled group of four leaves. On 0.7–1.3\\xa0cm long petioles, the thick leaves are ovate to ellipictal and measure 7–10\\xa0cm (3–4\\xa0in) long and 2.5–4.5\\xa0cm (1–2\\xa0in) across with recurved margins. Their upper surface is a dull dark green, and lower surface much paler, either covered by fine hairs in subspecies glomulifera or smooth in glabra.[5] Flowering takes place from August to December, peaking in September.[6] The cream flowers are fused in groups of seven into compound flowerheads.[5] This is followed by the development of the compound fruit – 1 to 2\\xa0cm (0.39 to 0.79\\xa0in) diameter woody capsules which ripen in summer.[6]\\nThe turpentine is found in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, from Atherton in the far north to as far south as Murramarang National Park.[5][7] North of Gympie, the distribution is fragmented, with colonies on the Blackdown and Consuelo Tablelands, Tinaroo district and Windsor Tableland.[5] The habitat most commonly associated with the turpentine is transitional forest between rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest.[5] Here it grows as an emergent tree,[7] and is associated with such trees as flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), tallowwood (E. microcorys), grey ironbark (E. paniculata), white stringybark (E. globoidea), yellow stringybark (E. muelleriana), white-topped box (E. quadrangulata), rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and various rainforest species.[5][6] It also grows with spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) and blackbutt (E. pilularis).[5] On poorer soils, it can grow much smaller in dry sclerophyll forest in association with smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) and yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia).[6]\\nAdaptable to a wide range of soils, the turpentine is most suited to moderate to high-nutrient soils, such as clay soil over Wianamatta shale in the Sydney region.[6] Valleys and flat areas are highly suitable sites.[5] In the Sydney region, the species reaches an altitude of 300\\xa0m (980\\xa0ft), but this extends to 900\\xa0m (3,000\\xa0ft) above sea level in northern Queensland.[5]\\nThe turpentine is one of the dominant species of the critically endangered Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest ecological community.[6]\\nThe largest known turpentine, located near the Williams River Recreation Reserve in the Barrington Tops National Park, New South Wales, measures 7.90\\xa0m (26\\xa0ft) trunk circumference at breast height, 58\\xa0m (190\\xa0ft) tall, 20\\xa0m (66\\xa0ft) crown spread width and \"points 517\" (points calculated using the National Register of Big Trees formula).[8]\\nThe flowers are pollinated by native bees and European honeybees, and possibly flies and moths. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) also pollinate the flowers. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus) and noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) forage for nectar.[6]\\nThe turpentine regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber and epicormic buds. Turpentine trees are thought to live up to 500 years.[6]\\nHighly durable, turpentine timber is used in heavy-traffic flooring, for poles and wharves. It resists marine invertebrates and termites, and is one of the most difficult timbers to ignite.[5] A hardy and adaptable tree, turpentine tolerates heavy soils and frosts, and is suitable for large gardens and parks, where it provides good shade with its dense canopy.[4]\\nBenedetti–Wehrli Stadium is a stadium in Naperville, Illinois. It is primarily used for American football, soccer and track and field and has a seating capacity of 5,500.[1]\\nBenedetti–Wehrli Stadium is named after two North Central College Alumni/Donors: Albert Benedetti and Richard Wehrli. The stadium opened in 1999 for North Central College and was used by the Chicago Fire in 2002 and 2003, when it was known as Cardinal Stadium. Benedetti–Wehrli hosts two highly hyped high school football games featuring Naperville Central High School versus Naperville North High School and Waubonsie Valley  High School versus Neuqua Valley High School. The stadium also serves as host to a competitive drum corps show hosted by The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps of Rosemont, Ill., each summer. \\nThe stadium hosted the 2000 NCAA Division III Men\\'s Outdoor Track and Field Championship.[2] The stadium also served as a venue for the quarter finals of the 2000 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. In 2018, the stadium became the home field for the Chicago Wildfire of the American Ultimate Disc League.[3]\\nThis article about a sports venue in Illinois is a stub.

By order from March 1, 1985, it is designated as 897th Helicopter Reconnaissance and Liaison Squadron.

The orphans were married to native rulers or Portuguese settlers.[1]\\nOrfãs do Rei translates to \"Orphans of the King\", and they were all girls. Their fathers were Portuguese men who died in battle for the king.[2][3] They were sent to the colonies of the Portuguese Empire.[4][5] The Asian colonies contained more Portuguese females than was previously thought.[6] Bernard Sta Maria wrote that \"From 1545, King John III began to send to India (and the Far East) with all pomp and distinction many young Portuguese women known as \\'Orphans of the Queen\\' to be married with local young men.\" Both noble and non-noble girls were in the órfãs do rei.[7][8][9]\\nSince these girls were specifically designated as the \"King\\'s\", the Portuguese government paid for their care and upbringing before and after they were sent to Portuguese India.[5][10] Goa in particular received most of the girls.[11][12] Some were also sent to the colony of Brazil.[13] The \"Shelter of the Castle\" was one of the organizations which arranged for the órfãs do rei to be sent overseas. The age limits were 12–30 years of age.[14]\\nThey departed from Lisbon and other Portuguese cities and arrived in Portuguese India, most of them were sent to Goa. Incentives such as dowries were given with the girls to potential husbands. The dowries consisted of official positions or land.[15][16] Regarding the timespan of the órfãs do rei being sent overseas, it was said that \"the system apparently continued to function intermittently until the (early) eighteenth century.\" [17]\\nIn particular, extensive boatloads of girls and their dowries were sent by Queen Catarina de Austria.[18] During the Iberian Union, the Habsburg King of Portugal continued the policy of sending female orphans to Goa, ignoring protests from the Portuguese authorities there.[19] Being \"white, Catholic, and of good birth\" were the requirements for a girl to become an órfão do rei. The reason that the authorities protested against the King sending the órfãs to India was the lack of husbands.[20] A proponent of the continued shipment of Portuguese girls to India was Fr. Álvaro Penteado.[21] One of the aims of shipping the órfãs was to stop Portuguese men from marrying women of other races and provide them with Portuguese wives.[22][23][24][25] The prevention of mixed-marriage would have resulted in a greater amount of white Portuguese.[26] The sex ratio between men and women in Goa was skewed, and the shipments of órfãs do rei was an attempt to correct this.[27]\\nFrederick Charles Danvers wrote in 1894 that \"It had for some time been customary to send out orphan girls to India, from orphanages at Lisbon, with the view of getting them husbands and so providing for them, and, at the same time, with the view of furnishing wives of their own nation to the Portuguese in India, to prevent them from marrying native Indian women. In many instances these orphans were also provided with dowries by the State, which occasionally took the form of appointments in the Government service, which, though given to the girls themselves, were of course intended to be filled by their husbands. Appointments were similarly given to the daughters of Indian officials on their marriage, in consideration of the good services rendered to the State by their respective parents; in one case this dowry took the form of the appointment of Governor of Cranganor.\"[28]\\nAfonso de Albuquerque also brought in Portuguese orphan girls to Portuguese Malacca in order to colonize the area.[29][30]\\nOne tale related how some Dutch privateers seized a ship with Portuguese orphan girls and took them as brides.[31] James Talboys Wheeler wrote in 1881 that \"It was the custom of the king of Portugal to send a number of well-born orphan girls every year to Goa, with sufficient dowries to procure them husbands in Portuguese India. Donna Lucia was one of three Portuguese orphan girls of good family who had been sent to India the previous year. The fleet which carried them was attacked by the Dutch, who captured some of the ships, and carried off the three damsels to Surat. Being passably handsome, most eminent merchants in Surat were anxious to marry them. All three became Protestants, and were provided with Protestant husbands. Two had gone off with their husbands to Java or elsewhere, but Donna Lucia had married the wealthiest Dutchman at Surat and remained there. Delia Valle found, however, to his great joy, that Donna Lucia was only a Protestant in name. She had been obliged to conform publicly to the Protestant \"heresy,\" but was a Catholic in private, with the knowledge and connivance of her Protestant husband\".[32]\\nBahia in Brazil received some of the orphans in 1551.[33]\\nFrançois Pyrard of Laval in his account of his voyages, observed some Portuguese merchants, when their ship was in danger, \"It was a very miracle that saved us, for the wind was from the sea, and we were so close ashore that we had great difficulty in doubling the point and getting out. I believe more than 1,500 crowns\\' worth of vows were made, which were afterwards duly paid. The principal merchant made one of 800 cruzados: to wit, 400 for an orphan girl to marry withal, and 400 for a lamp and other utensils for a shrine of Our Lady that is hard by. As soon as he set foot on land he sought out an orphan girl, and fulfilled his promise to her, as also to the churchwardens of the said church. Many others, too, did the like; nor did any fail therein, according to his means and the extent of his vows. It is a custom of the Portuguese, when they are in peril, to make these vows; but the worst of it is that it makes them indolent and careless about working stoutly to save their lives.\"[34]\\n1,000 xerafins were added to the dowry by Conde de Redondo in order to attract suitors for the orphans.[35] Female orphans born in India did not have the same privileges as the órfãs do rei.[36]\\nSome órfãs do rei married native rulers who were either in exile or allied to the Portuguese.[4][37]\\nThe exiled former ruler (liwali) of Pemba converted to Christianity from Islam and was married to an órfã do rei named Dona Anna de Sepulveda in 1607. He also changed his name to Felipe da Gama, Dom Filipe, or Philip. However, he later reverted to Islam.[38][39][40][41][42] A son, Estevão was born of their marriage.[43] He was exiled from Pemba to Mombasa in 1596.[44]\\nIn the 1500s the exiled ruler of the Maldives, Hassan converted to Christianity and also married a Portuguese orphan.[45] Her name was D. Francisca de Vasconcelos.[46][47][48][49] The Portuguese girls also in Goa married native high caste Christians.[50]\\nOne of the Portuguese orphans kidnapped by the Dutch privateer ended up in Akbar the Great\\'s harem.[51]\\nDating back to the mid-1960s, with intercollegiate competition beginning in 1977, bowling at Morehead State University is a club sport and is affiliated with the collegiate division of the United States Bowling Congress.\\nThe Larry Wilson University Lanes, built in 1967, are housed in the Laughlin Health Building on the campus of Morehead State University. The six-lane center, open to the campus community, serves as the practice facility for the MSU bowling teams.\\nDuring the 2006-2007 academic year, the center was completely remodeled. The lanes are now equipped with Brunswick A-2 pin spotters and were resurfaced with the state-of-the-art Kegel Edge synthetic lane surface. The Larry Wilson University Lanes are one of two bowling facilities in the United States to use this surface. The settee and counter areas were refurbished with new flooring, lighting, and furniture.  New masking units were added as well.\\nThe lanes are maintained using the Kegel Phoenix-S. This machine is capable of having oil patterns uploaded, allowing the teams to prepare on patterns more similar to tournament conditions.\\nAdjacent to the Larry Wilson University Lanes is a team room to be used for storage of equipment by bowling team members as well as pro shop equipment.\\nIn 2009 the facility acquired a fully functional pro-shop to aid the MSU bowling team in getting all of their equipment drilled without having to travel to any surrounding bowling center.  The center is also USBC Sanctioned.\\nAlso over the summer, the old pins were replaced with the new synthetic Twister Pins.[1]\\nThe MSU women have won national championships in 1989, 1998, 2000 and 2002, were runners-up in 1993, and finished in third place in 2006 and 2008.[2]\\nSince 2002, the Morehead State women\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 six times, from the 2002-2003 season up to the 2007-2008 season.[3]\\nSince 2002, the Morehead State men\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 in 2002–2003 and 2004–2005 seasons.

It is located south of Steubenville and just east of Hillsboro along Wilson Avenue, at 40°20′00″N 80°37′03″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff40.33333°N 80.61750°W\\ufeff / 40.33333; -80.61750.[2][3]\\nThe community was originally laid out in 23 lots on top of a local hill, the name \"Altamont Hill\" dating back to before the Civil War. In 1899, the Steubenville, Mingo & Ohio Valley Traction Company (later the Steubenville & Wheeling Traction Company) built an electric street railroad from Steubenville to Brilliant and Mingo Junction going over Altamont Hill (with a station in the Atlamont community).  The Altamont line was rarely used though, due to the high grade, and after seven years was abandoned in favor of a lower grade junction that was built around the hill.[4]\\nThis Jefferson County, Ohio state location article is a stub.

Maudling\\'s primary instruments are Roland synthesizers when playing live. He comes from a musical family and was classically trained on piano from an early age. He has contributed to three My Dying Bride studio albums, provided session orchestration on material by Sermon of Hypocrisy, and played guest keyboards on a full-length release by the Ukrainian metal band Semargl. He composed music for the video game Adellion. Currently Maudling is a producer and engineer, operating his own recording studio called Waylands Forge Studios in Yorkshire, England.\\nAlthough he composes music mostly in the symphonic metal/black metal genres, Maudling\\'s main influences include mostly non-metal bands such as The Police, Tangerine Dream, Queen, Pat Metheny, as well as classical composers such as Wagner, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Messiaen and Holst.[citation needed]\\nMaudling was born in Kent  and grew up in Sheffield, Yorkshire. In Kent, Maudling\\'s parents lived opposite a music store. The store owner, Terry Bradford, who ended up representing Britain on the TV show A Song For Europe in the 1970s, was a friend of Maudling\\'s father and received free records, most of which were classical, contemporary music and Jazz.[citation needed]Jonny grew up listening to these records, educating himself in a wide variety of musical styles. He had private piano instruction, working through the Royal Academy of Music grade system under Elizabeth Hydes.[citation needed]\\nAt school in South Yorkshire, he learnt to play guitar and bass guitar. He played in various bands in his teen years, performing gigs in pubs and nightclubs around the area. He started song writing at this time. He bought his first synthesizer in the mid 1980s with the money he earned working on Saturdays. After completing school, Maudling tried out for music college, but was considered a borderline candidate with substandard sight-reading ability. He opted instead to concentrate on band work.[citation needed]\\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s Maudling played bass, sang and composed songs for a thrash metal outfit called Igniter. This band recorded two demos and performed gigs around England, the most high profile of which was a support slot with prominent thrash metal outfit Xentrix\\nThrough Alistair MacLatchy, a former bandmate in Systematic Insanity with prominent extreme metal drummer Nicholas Barker, Maudling was introduced to vocalist/lyricist Byron Roberts in 1993. For several years, Roberts had been looking for talented musicians with whom to launch his symphonic black metal band Bal-Sagoth, but had been unable to meet anyone willing to commit to the project. As a result of MacLatchy\\'s introductions, Jonny, his brother Chris and Byron began working together in a band environment.\\nThis new outfit went loosely under the provisional name of \"Dusk\" for several months, as MacLatchy did not like the name Bal-Sagoth, nor the symphonic black metal direction which Roberts had suggested.\\nBecause of creative and musical differences in direction and style, the band soon parted ways with MacLatchy. With the introduction of keyboards, the band found their focus. Roberts had the creative team he had long sought to execute his conceptual vision. For Maudling, this represented an opportunity for creative musical freedom. Roberts, an English post-grad with an interest in 20th century pulp sci-fi writers, could finally implement the ideas he had had for years. The formal inception of Bal-Sagoth occurred during the summer of 1993.\\nOn the strength of their demo which they recorded during December 1993, the band were signed by Cacophonous Records, a then small subsidiary of Vinyl Solution based in London. Later, they would sign to Nuclear Blast for three albums, recording a total of six albums to date.\\nMaudling composes the music for Bal-Sagoth, sometimes incorporating ideas from his brother, guitarist Chris. He played drums on the first three albums and during subsequent tours, using a session keyboard player, but in 1999 Maudling opted to concentrate full-time on keyboards, handing drum duties off to Dave Mackintosh (DragonForce).\\nMaudling also played keyboards on the My Dying Bride albums The Light at the End of the World and The Dreadful Hours, and composed and recorded all the music for the My Dying Bride release Evinta, based on the existing compositions as originally written by Andrew Craighan, Hamish Glencross, et al. He has also contributed keyboard session work to bands including Semargl and Sermon of Hypocrisy.\\nIn February 2013, Maudling helmed Kull, a new project in the symphonic metal sphere.\\nIn October 2017 it was announced that Maudling had provided orchestration for the new Elvenking album Secrets Of The Magick Grimoire.[citation needed]\\nOn 24 May 2019 the debut album of Maudling\\'s new musical project \"Kull\" was released by the Swedish independent label Black Lion Records.\\nMaudling has used various keyboards and synthesizers over the years including Casio CZ-1000, Yamaha Dx21, Korg M1, Roland XP-50 and Roland Fantom X7, Korg Kronos X.\\nMister Bones (Robert Todd) is a fictional character in the DC Comics Universe, created by Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas, and Todd McFarlane, in Infinity, Inc. #16 (July 1985).[1] A former low-level supervillain, he reformed and joined the Infinity Inc. team, then later the (fictional) Department of Extranormal Operations (a government agency which regulates superhero activity) as a bureaucrat, eventually rising to the rank of Regional Director for the Eastern Seaboard. Thus, he now wears a suit and tie instead of a costume, and is also known as Director Bones.[2] A chain-smoker, he had a habit of speaking in rhyme in early appearances, but he no longer does so.\\nKeith David provides the voice of Mister Bones in Stargirl.\\nDr. Benjamin (also known as Amos) Love, a gynecologist, injected six pregnant women with an experimental mutagenic drug. Each of the women gave birth to a metahuman child. Dr. Love kidnapped the infants and raised them himself, never allowing them to leave the house. The children learned all they knew from books, radio, and television. Later, the six young adults learned the true story of their origin from reading Love\\'s diary and confronted him. They decided to execute him for what he did to them and Bones took Dr. Love out in the desert alone to kill him with his cyanide touch; the doctor begged for his life and Bones felt pity for him and let him go. Bones later showed the rest of his \"family\" the grave of Dr. Love.[3] After the supposed death of Dr. Love, taking their cue from the superheroes they had watched on television, the six created costumes to go with the names Doctor Love had given them and called their group Helix.[2]\\nThe team kidnapped the Infinitor Fury in an attempt to extort money. Although they were defeated by Fury\\'s teammates, Infinity, Inc., Helix managed to escape.[4] Later, the second Wildcat (Yolanda Montez) learned that she was in fact a cousin of Helix\\'s new member, Carcharo, and that they are both products of the same genetic experiments as Helix. The two teams battled to a stalemate and Mr. Bones was arrested while the others escaped. Later, Mr. Bones was freed from prison by Dr. Love.[5]\\nCarcharo soon turned on the Helix and kidnapped Mr. Bones. In the ensuing struggle Carcharo is stabbed with a long piece of metal and in a last-ditch effort bit Bones\\' leg off, and then died from cyanide poisoning (see Powers and abilities). To make sure Bones got medical care, Helix turned themselves in to the authorities.[6] Mr. Bones received an artificial leg and Dr. Beth Chapel (Doctor Midnight) helped him recover from his injuries, and the two formed a friendly relationship.\\nSince they were minors, an informal court hearing was held to determine the fate of the members of Helix. It was found that Mr. Bones had too much of a negative influence on them. Infinity, Inc. was given custody of Bones while the rest of the Helix would receive treatment.\\nFor most of his time with Infinity, Inc. Mr. Bones was not a member of the team even though he took an active part in their adventures and became a hero in his own right, and was eventually accepted by most of the Infinitors.[2] During the wedding of Hector and Lyta Hall, Harlequin (Marcie Cooper) used deception to have Bones and Skyman meet at Solomon Grundy\\'s room. She then deceived Solomon Grundy into grabbing Bones\\' arm and using him to kill Skyman with his cyanide touch.[7]\\nWracked with guilt, Bones left Infinity, Inc. When Dr. Love gained control of Helix and ordered them to kill Bones, Helix instead turned on Love, killing him. Helix then left in disgust, telling Bones he was no longer one of them. The Infinitors, though, granted Bones full membership in the team, but Bones\\' role in Skyman\\'s death would end up being instrumental in their disbanding soon afterward.\\nAt some point after Infinity, Inc. disbanded, Mr. Bones became Director of a local branch of the U.S. Department of Extranormal Operations (D.E.O.), and as a D.E.O., Director Bones has had numerous interactions with the operations of the superhuman community.[2] He has at times asked various DCU teams for their covert assistance. Notably, he has worked with the Justice Society of America a few times, to the point that Mister Terrific infiltrated the D.E.O. headquarters to tell Mr. Bones to stop harassing them. Bones was also wary of Atom Smasher, his old fellow Infinitor, after his murder of Extant. Mr. Bones became a supporting character in Manhunter.\\nMr. Bones and the operations of the D.E.O. are featured in the DC Files Secret Files and Origins Year 2000 special.\\nIn a Final Crisis tie-in, Mr. Bones is seen as one of the fallen during a strike against Wonder Woman\\'s Female Furies in Blüdhaven, with Count Vertigo and Negative Woman.[8] He later survived the encounter as he is seen with Atom Smasher in a bar in Justice Society of America (vol. 2) #27 discussing the aforementioned incident and the latter\\'s position on the team. When Rothstein leaves with other Society members, Bones is seen on the telephone calling the Global Peace Agency.\\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe. Mr. Bones is shown to be acting as the D.E.O.\\'s director and tasks agent Cameron Chase with capturing Batwoman.[9] Bones now believes himself to be Col. Jacob Kane\\'s illegitimate son.[10][11][12][a] He captures Beth Kane, sister of Batwoman, and blackmails Batwoman into agreeing to uncover Batman\\'s secret identity.[13] Batwoman, Col. Kane\\'s \"Murder of Crows\" elite paramilitary group, and the heroine Hawkfire fail to rescue Beth. Agent Asaf, compromised by Hawkfire,[14] shoots Bones in the head after he threatens to kill Beth rather than hand her over.[12][b] Asaf later says Bones was mentally unbalanced, and is not Jacob Kane\\'s son.[12]\\nIn the pages of \"Infinite Frontier\", Mister Bones is talking to Cameron Chase about the recent events that have transpired since the events of \"Dark Nights: Death Metal\" that revealed the Multiverse to everyone.[15] While on Earth Omega, Mister Bones was revealed to have shot down Cameron Chase ship and says that he made a deal with Darkseid to spare their Earth in exchange for others. Jade knocks down Mister Bones.[16] After Darkseid has teleported all the heroes off of Earth Omega and back to their respectful Earths, Mister Bones was mentioned to have gotten away upon being returned to Prime-Earth.[17]\\nBones\\' mother\\'s exposure to mutagenic drugs during pregnancy gave him three superhuman powers, two of which are extremely inconvenient to his daily life: first, his skin (which, it has been indicated, would otherwise be black), flesh, and organs are all transparent, giving him the appearance of a denuded skeleton (thus his name); second, his skin constantly exudes a cyanide-based compound (in effect a toxic sweat), which is almost invariably lethal to anyone who touches him (as a corollary, he is immune to cyanide poisoning); third, he possesses superhuman strength.\\nMister Bones is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series.[18] During World War II, the man who would become Mister Bones was a member of, and presumably the leader of, a government task force codenamed \"ShadowPact\", created to counter the Axis Thule Society. Other members included Felix Faust and John Zatara, though the latter left the team after their first mission. At some point, Shadowpact came into contact with the Olympian god Hades, who promised them eternal youth if they aided him in escaping from the prison he had been sealed in by his brother, Zeus, and the queen of the Amazon tribe, Hippolyta. Bones could not fulfill his end of the bargain and was punished by the ancient deity, who used magic to turn Bones\\' skin, muscles and organs invisible and stain his bones black, giving the agent the appearance of a walking skeleton. In the present, Bones is the head of the government agency D.E.O. and uses a weekly treatment with body paint to appear normal and carry out day-to-day matters.\\nMister Bones appears in The CW live-action television series Stargirl, voiced by Keith David. This version is the director of the Helix Institute for Youth Rehabilitation. After being alluded to in the episode \"Summer School: Chapter Ten\", his subordinate Nurse Louise Love informs him of Blue Valley\\'s super-powered individuals and he makes plans to visit it in the episode \"Summer School: Chapter Thirteen\".\\n\\nCrematogaster cornigera is a species of ant in tribe Crematogastrini.[1] It was described by Forel in 1902.[1]\\n\\nThis Crematogaster-related article is a stub.

She studied with her husband and made her debut in 1903 at the Theater of Bern, in Switzerland. In 1905, she sang at the Cologne Opera as the Queen of Sheba in La reine de Saba by Gounod, and as Isolde in Wagner\\'s masterpiece. Shortly after her role in Tristan, she was offered a six-year contract to sing in Cologne.\\nGuszalewicz continued to sing in Cologne until 1916 and toured throughout Europe. She also sang in several operas and gave recitals in Karlsruhe (1906), Düsseldorf (1907), Bremen (1908) and Dresden (1908). In Dresden at the Semperoper, she performed the title role in Salome for the first time. Her interpretation of Salome caused a sensation.\\nFor many years, however, a picture of her performance was thought to in fact show the play\\'s author, Wilde in women\\'s drag. The picture was even reproduced in Richard Ellmann\\'s biography of him. It was not until Wilde\\'s grandson Merlin Holland corrected scholars in 1994 that the picture in fact showed Guszalewicz. This correction undermined readings of Wilde as a cross-dresser.[2]\\nShe performed at the Leipzig Opera (1908), at the Vienna State Opera (1910 in the role of Salome), at the Berlin State Opera (1911 as Brünnhilde and as Isolde), as well as in Brussels, Paris and Madrid. In 1905, she sang the lead role in Isidore de Lara\\'s opera Messaline in Cologne, which was a great success for her. The opera had 27 performances.\\nGuszalewicz gave concerts at the opera in Frankfurt am Main (1907), at the  Stadttheater of Bremen (1908) and at the National Theatre Munich (1910 as Salome). Her repertoire included the roles of Leonore in Fidelio, Adriano in Rienzi, Venus in Tannhäuser, the title role of Ingwelde in Max von Schillings\\' opera, Elektra (opera) in the opera of Richard Strauss, Berthe in Le prophète by Meyerbeer, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, the title role in Mascagni\\'s Amica, and Maria in A basso porto by Niccola Spinelli.\\nAfter ending her career, she worked as a teacher in Munich. Her daughter Genia Guszalewicz (1902–71) became one of her students, and she followed her mother into a career as an opera singer.\\nAlice Guszalewicz died at the age of 61 in Munich, Germany.\\n\\nGordon Marion Graham (February 16, 1918 – March 22, 2008) was a United States Air Force lieutenant general. Graham was a combat pilot who, during World War II was credited with 7 aerial victories making him a flying ace. He is credited with a further 9.5 aircraft destroyed on the ground. By the end of World War II, Graham had flown 73 combat missions in the P-51 Mustang.\\nGraham was born in Ouray, Colorado, in 1918. He attended Taft High School in Taft, California, and graduated from the University of California in 1940 with a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering.[1]\\nGraham began his military career in December 1940 as an aviation cadet and was commissioned as second lieutenant and received his pilot wings upon completion of flying school in August 1941.[1]\\nAfter a series of assignments as gunnery instructor and instructor pilot at various bases. During World War II, Graham joined the 355th Fighter Group in the Eighth Air Force in Europe in August 1944, stationed at RAF Steeple Morden. He commanded the 354th Fighter Squadron from October 1944 until June 1945 when he was transferred to the 361st Fighter Group to command the 374th Fighter Squadron. He assumed command of the 361st Fighter Group in August 1945.[1]\\nBy the end of World War II in Europe, General Graham had flown 73 combat missions in North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft and had become an ace 7 enemy aircraft in aerial combat plus 9.5 more while strafing airfields, to his credit, while flying with the 355th Fighter Group. In addition, he had one probable and 10 damaged. He was assistant chief of staff for operations, VIII Fighter Command, from October 1945 until February 1946.[1]\\nAfter four months as a civilian with the Socony Vacuum Company of Venezuela, he returned to active military duty with the U.S. Army Air Corps in September 1946 as deputy assistant for operations, Tenth Air Force, at Brooks Field. He later served as commander of Reserve training detachments at Brooks and Carswell fields, Texas.[1]\\nIn 1947, Graham entered the University of Pittsburgh under the Air Force Institute of Technology program, earning a Master of Science degree in 1948. In his next two assignments, General Graham was industrial mobilization training consultant to the Union Oil Company of California and the Shell Oil Company.[1]\\nBetween September 1949 and December 1954, Graham served as chief of the Target Analysis Division in the Office of the Director of Intelligence at Headquarters U.S. Air Force and then as director of targets in the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters Far East Air Forces in Japan, during the Korean War[1]\\nGraham returned to the United States in January 1955 and served first as deputy commander and then from October 1955 as commander of the 31st Strategic Fighter Wing at Turner Air Force Base. As commander, he performed the navigation for his wing\\'s lead element during \"Operation Left Hook,\" a Strategic Air Command fighter wing bombing and navigation competition. The 31st Strategic Fighter Wing won the navigation and maintenance trophies and took second place honors among the seven wings entered in the competition.[1]\\nGraham led a series of F-84 Thunderjet jet aircraft \"Oil Burner\" missions which demonstrated that nonstop air refueled, day and night long-range deployments in fighter aircraft were practical. In 1958 he led the first nonstop deployment of F-100 Super Sabre aircraft from the United States to Europe, and he was captain of the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing team which won the Tactical Air Command Fighter Weapons Meet and placed second in worldwide tactical fighter weapons competition.[1]\\nIn January 1959 he returned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as chief of the Tactical Division and later was director of operational forces in the Directorate of Operations. In July 1962 he went to Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, to command the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing and in October 1963 was named vice commander of the Nineteenth Air Force. Graham moved to Langley Air Force Base, in November 1964 to become a member of the Headquarters Tactical Air Command staff. He served as Deputy for Operations from August 1965 to July 1966.[1]\\nHe next went to Southeast Asia and assignment as vice commander of the Seventh Air Force where he flew 146 combat missions in F-4 Phantom and RF-4 Phantom aircraft. He returned to the United States in August 1967 to become commander of the Ninth Air Force at Shaw Air Force Base. In August 1968 General Graham returned to Langley Air Force Base as vice commander of Tactical Air Command.[1]\\nGraham was assigned as commander, U.S. Forces Japan, and commander, Fifth Air Force, with headquarters at Fuchu Air Station, in February 1970.[1]\\nAt the conclusion of this tour of duty, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (First Class) by Japan and the Order of National Security Merit (Gug-Seon Medal) by the Republic of Korea. In November 1972 he was assigned to Izmir, Turkey, as commander, Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force.[1]\\nFor his service in the Republic of Vietnam, Graham was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. He has also earned the Silver Star; Legion of Merit; Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster; Air Medal with 27 oak leaf clusters; Joint Service Commendation Medal; Air Force Commendation Medal; Republic of Korea Order of Military Merit; National Order of Vietnam (5th class); Vietnamese Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (1st class); the Vietnamese Armed Forces Honor Medal (1st class); Vietnamese Air Force Pilot Wings; Republic of Korea Air Force Pilot Wings; and Chinese Air Force Pilot Wings.[1]\\nGraham was a command pilot who, in accruing 9,000 flying hours, flew all of the U.S. Air Force century series jet fighters including the F-111A Aardvark and comparable U.S. Navy fighter aircraft such as the A-7 Corsair. He completed the U.S. Army Airborne Parachutist Course in 1962 and was jump qualified.[1]\\nGraham was a member of Tau Beta Pi, the national honorary engineering society; American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers; American Fighter Aces Association; Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association; Order of Daedalians; Air Force Association; and a life member of the National Rifle Association.[1]\\nGraham died on March 22, 2008, of a stroke at his home in Irvington, Virginia and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.[2]\\n\\nMatthew James Johnston (born 15 October 1985) is an Australian former professional cricketer who played for Tasmania, Western Australia, Adelaide Strikers and Hobart Hurricanes.\\nJohnston played grade cricket for Willetton, and won the Olly Cooley Medal for best player in the Western Australian Grade Cricket competition in 2010 and 2011.[1]\\nHe played one first-class, 17 List A and four Twenty20 cricket matches for Western Australia between 2007 and 2011, before being dropped at the end of the 2010–11 season.

Proton Mail received initial funding through a crowdfunding campaign. Although the default account setup is free, the service is sustained by optional paid services. Initial membership was by invitation only, however beginning in March 2016, Proton Mail was opened to the public. Acquiring no fewer than 2 million users by 2017,[9] membership grew to almost 70 million by 2022.[10]\\nOn 16 May 2014, Proton Mail entered into public beta.[11] It was met with enough response that after three days they needed to temporarily suspend beta signups to expand server capacity.[12] Two months later, Proton Mail received US$550,377 from 10,576 donors through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, while aiming for US$100,000.[13] During the campaign, PayPal froze Proton Mail\\'s PayPal account, thereby preventing the withdrawal of US$251,721 worth of donations. PayPal stated that the account was frozen due to doubts of the legality of encryption, statements that opponents said were unfounded.[14][15] The restrictions were lifted the following day.[16]\\nOn 18 March 2015, Proton Mail received US$2 million from the non-profit Fondation Genevoise pour l\\'Innovation Technologique (FONGIT) and Charles River Ventures, although by 2022, the company no longer had venture capital investors.[17][18] On 14 August 2015, Proton Mail released major version 2.0, which included a rewritten codebase for its web interface. On 17 March 2016, Proton Mail released major version 3.0, which saw the official launch of Proton Mail out of beta. With a new interface for the web client, version 3.0 also included the public launch of Proton Mail\\'s iOS and Android beta applications.[19]\\nOn 19 January 2017, Proton Mail announced a Tor onion site.[20] On 21 November 2017, Proton Mail introduced Proton Mail Contacts, a zero-access encryption contacts manager. Proton Mail Contacts also utilizes digital signatures to verify the integrity of contacts data.[21] On 6 December 2017, Proton Mail launched Proton Mail Bridge, an application that provides end-to-end email encryption to any desktop client that supports IMAP and SMTP, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail, for Windows and MacOS.[22]\\nOn 25 July 2018, Proton Mail introduced address verification and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) support, making Proton Mail interoperable with other PGP clients.[23]\\nThe source code for the back-end remains closed source.[24][25] However, Proton Mail released the source code for the web interface under an open-source license.[26] Proton Mail also open sourced their mobile clients for iOS and Android,[27][28] as well the Proton Mail Bridge app.[29] All of their source code can be found on GitHub.\\nIn September 2020, Proton Mail helped found the Coalition for App Fairness, which aims to gain better conditions for the inclusion of their apps in app stores.[30] Proton also founded the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets, which brings together 50+ European tech companies supporting open, interoperable and competitive digital markets. [31]\\nIn May 2022, Proton AG updated the visuals, user interface, and logos of all its products, including Proton Mail, to achieve a consistent design throughout its software. Proton Mail\\'s subscription now includes access to all Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive.[32]\\nProton Mail uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to offer end-to-end encryption. When a user creates a Proton Mail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private RSA keys:\\nThis symmetrical encryption happens in the user\\'s web browser using AES-256. Upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account.\\nProton Mail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode that requires a login password and a mailbox password.\\nUpon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. This is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. The decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. The public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on Proton Mail servers. Thus Proton Mail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so Proton Mail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords.[33] This system absolves Proton Mail from:\\nProton Mail exclusively supports HTTPS and uses TLS with ephemeral key exchange to encrypt all Internet traffic between users and Proton Mail servers. Proton Mail holds an \"A+\" rating from Qualys SSL Labs.[35]\\nIn September 2015, Proton Mail added native support to their web interface and mobile app for PGP. This allows a user to export their Proton Mail PGP-encoded public key to others outside of Proton Mail, enabling them to use the key for email encryption. The Proton Mail also supports PGP encryption from Proton Mail to outside users.[36] Proton Mail also has support for searching within encrypted message content. [37]\\nAn email message sent from one Proton Mail account to another is automatically encrypted with the public key of the recipient. Once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the message. When the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox.\\nEmail messages sent from Proton Mail to non-Proton Mail email addresses may optionally be sent in plain text or with end-to-end encryption. With encryption, the message is encrypted with AES under a user-supplied password. The recipient receives a link to the Proton Mail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted message. Proton Mail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a backchannel.[33] Such email messages can be set to self-destruct after a period of time.[38]\\nBoth Proton Mail and Proton VPN are located in Switzerland to avoid any surveillance or information requests from countries under the Fourteen Eyes, and/or under government surveillance laws like the United States\\' Patriot Act or outside the bounds of law.[citation needed]\\nThe company claims that it is also located in Switzerland because of its strict privacy laws.[39]\\nProton Mail currently supports two-factor authentication with TOTP tokens for its login process.[40] As of October 2019, according to the official Proton Mail blog, U2F support for YubiKey and FIDO physical security keys is currently under development and will be available soon after the release of v4.0.[41]\\nIn 2021, Proton Mail\\'s security and cryptographic architecture were both independently audited by Securitum, a leading European security auditing company, who uncovered no major issues or security vulnerabilities, and the audit results were publicly published. [42]\\nProton Mail limits data portability by locking support for external email client software through IMAP and POP3 protocols behind a paywall. As of 2021, users are unable to back up their email account locally without paying.[43]\\nProton Mail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party. It maintains two data centres, one in Lausanne and another in Attinghausen (in the former K7 military bunker under 1,000 metres (3,300\\xa0ft) of granite) as a backup. Since the servers are located in Switzerland, they are legally outside of the jurisdiction of the European Union, United States, and other countries. Under Swiss law, all surveillance requests from foreign countries must go through a Swiss court and are subject to international treaties. Prospective surveillance targets are promptly notified and can appeal the request in court.[44]\\nEach data centre uses load balancing across web, mail, and SQL servers, redundant power supply, hard drives with full disk encryption, and exclusive use of Linux and other open-source software. In December 2014, Proton Mail joined the RIPE NCC in an effort to have more direct control over the surrounding Internet infrastructure.[45]\\nFrom 3 to 7 November 2015, Proton Mail was under several DDoS attacks that made the service largely unavailable to users.[46] During the attacks, the company stated on Twitter that it was looking for a new data center in Switzerland, saying, \"many are afraid due to the magnitude of the attack against us\".[47]\\nIn July 2018, Proton Mail reported it was once more suffering from DDoS attacks. CEO Andy Yen claimed that the attackers had been paid by an unknown party to launch the attacks.[48] In September 2018, one of the suspected Proton Mail attackers was arrested by British law enforcement and charged in connection with a series of other high-profile cyberattacks against schools and airlines.[49]\\nOn 22 April 2020, Proton Mail confirmed on its Proton VPN Twitter that Proton Mail and Proton VPN are banned in China because it doesn\\'t allow the government to spy.[50]\\nOn 15 November 2019, Proton confirmed that government of the Republic of Belarus had issued a block across the country of Proton Mail and Proton VPN IP addresses. The block was no longer in place four days later. No explanation was given to Proton Mail for the block, nor for the block being lifted.[51]\\nOn 29 January 2020, the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media reported that it had implemented a complete block of Proton Mail services within the Russian Federation.[52] As a reason for the block, it cited Proton Mail\\'s refusal to give up information relating to accounts that allegedly sent out spam with terror threats.[53][54] However, Proton Mail claimed that it did not receive any requests from Russian authorities regarding any such accounts.[55][56] In response to the block, the Proton Mail Twitter account recommended legitimate users circumvent the block via VPNs or Tor.\\nIn March 2020, the company announced that even though the Russia ban was not particularly successful and the service continues to be largely available in Russia without utilising a VPN, Proton Mail will be releasing new anti-censorship features in both Proton Mail and Proton VPN desktop and mobile apps which will allow more block attempts to be automatically circumvented.[57]\\nAccording to Proton Mail\\'s transparency report, it is legally obligated to follow Swiss court orders if Swiss law is broken, and in 2020 Proton Mail received 3,572 orders from Swiss authorities and contested 750 of them.[58] Due to the encryption utilized, Proton Mail is unable to hand over the contents of encrypted emails under any circumstances, but according to Proton\\'s privacy policy, Proton Mail can be legally compelled to log IP addresses as part of a Swiss criminal investigation.[59] For this reason, the company strongly suggests that users who need to hide their identity from the Swiss government use their Tor hidden service/onion site. In May 2022, Proton updated its privacy policy and made explicit a separate privacy policy for its Proton VPN service, which has a different treatment under Swiss law and has a strict no-logs policy which was also confirmed by an external audit.[60]\\nNotable cases involving Swiss court orders include a case involving death threats made against well-known immunologist Anthony Fauci and a case against French citizens charged with theft and destruction of property.[61][62] After these cases, in October 2021, Proton Mail won an important Swiss court victory that confirmed that email services cannot be considered telecommunications providers, and consequently are not subject to the data retention requirements imposed on telecommunications providers.[63]\\nAs of 25\\xa0May\\xa02022[update], Proton Mail offers the following account types:[64]\\n[c 2]\\nThe case method is a teaching approach that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the casebook method of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar Christopher C. Langdell. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.[1]\\nThe case method evolved from the casebook method, a mode of teaching based on Socratic principles pioneered at Harvard Law School by Christopher C. Langdell. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.\\nA decision-forcing case is a kind of decision game.  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.\\nA decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\"  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively.[2]\\nIn recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.[3] It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns.[4]\\nEvery decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.\\nSome case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\"[5]\\nAfter discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at Harvard University) \"the \\'B\\' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.\\nWhatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\"  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.\\nSome case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"Analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, \"can be all the more powerful when the \\'what happened\\' is left unanswered.[6]\\nA classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.\\nA decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\"  Also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"staff rides\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by Gerhard von Scharnhorst in 1801 and made famous by the elder Hellmuth von Moltke in the middle years of the nineteenth century.\\nTo avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia, adopted the term \"Russell Ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General John Henry Russell Jr.,USMC, the 16th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction.[7]\\nDecision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.\\nA decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\"  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an \"open-face\" or \"smørrebrød\" case.[8]\\nA decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions in a relatively short period of time is sometimes called a \"White Castle\", \"slider\" case.[9] or \"day in the life\" case.\\nCase materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.\\nCase materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \"the B-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as \"handouts.\") [10]\\nCase materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.[11]\\nA number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.  These organizations include:\\nThe Case Centre (formerly the European Case Clearing House), headquartered in Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedford, United Kingdom, and with its US office at Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts, is the independent home of the case method.[15][16] It is a membership-based organization with more than 500 members worldwide, not-for-profit organisation and registered charity founded in 1973.[17]\\nThe Case Centre is the world’s largest and most diverse repository of case studies[18] used in Management Education, with cases from the world’s top case publishing schools, including, Harvard Business School, ICFAI Business School Hyderabad, INSEAD, IMD, Ivey Business School, Darden School of Business, London Business School, etc. Its stated aim is to promote the case method by sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise in this area among teachers and students, and for this it engages in various activities like conducting case method workshops, offering case scholarships, publishing a journal,[16] and organizing a global case method awards.\\nThe Case Centre Awards (known as the European Awards from 1991 and 2010) recognises outstanding case writers and teachers worldwide.[19][20] These prestigious awards, popularly known as the case method community\\'s annual \\'Oscars\\',[19][21] or the “business education Oscars,[22] celebrate worldwide excellence in case writing and teaching.[23]\\nThe presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem.  This can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\"  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality.[24]\\nTechniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" – information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.\\nThe case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.[25]\\nIn his classic essay on the case method (\"Because Wisdom Can\\'t Be Told\"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that \"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\"  [26]\\nWhile the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement.  These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:\\nThomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\"[27]\\nCase materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \"best practices\" fallacies.  Here are some examples of such disclaimers:\\nThe case method is used in a variety of professional schools.  These include the:\\nUniversity of Fujairah- MBA Program\\nMelissa Siegel (born 8 April 1981) is an American academic specialising in migration.

It was founded in 1866 as a mission of Immaculate Conception Parish of Amenia. In 1885 it became a mission of St. John the Evangelist\\'s Church in Pawling, and was finally itself elevated to parish status in 1936.\\nDover Plains was a branch mission served first by Father Michael Riordan, pastor of St. Peter\\'s, Poughkeepsie; then later by Denis Sheehan, pastor of St. Mary\\'s, Wappingers Falls.\\nIn 1859 Archbishop Hughes appointed Rev. Charles Slevin, as the first resident priest. Father Slavin became responsible for the whole Harlem Valley. He resided at Dover Plains and built the church there. Dover Plains was chosen as the headquarters for the missions of Amenia, Beekman, Millbrook, Millerton, and Pawling, where there were no churches.  It was Father Slevin who built St. Charles\\' church. He was drafted during the Civil War, but his congregation made up the $300 fee to gain his exemption. Father Slevin left in 1864. His successor, Rev. John Arsenigo lived in Purdy\\'s Station.[1]\\nIn 1886 Father Tandy became resident Pastor at Immaculate Conception in Amenia, with Pawling and Dover as missions.  With the appointment in 1872 of Father Healy to St. John the Evangelist responsibility for St. Charles\\' mission was transferred to Pawling.[2]\\nIn September 2018, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York, officially decreed the merger of St. John the Evangelist with St. Charles Borromeo, creating the new parish church of St. John the Evangelist-St. Charles Borromeo.  The main parish office is now located in Pawling, NY.  Each church retains its own Sunday Mass schedule but is served now under one pastor.[citation needed]\\nOur Lady of Solace Chapel in nearby Wingdale was part of St. Charles Borromeo parish in Dover Plains until 2013.[3] The mission Chapel was established in 1962 and staffed by Capuchin friars. The main purpose of the mission was to serve those at the psychiatric hospital in Wingdale—the hospital closed in the 1994, but a juvenile detention center remained open directly across from the church.

The squadron was originally named the Mediterranean Squadron and renamed following the American Civil War. In 1905, the squadron was absorbed into the North Atlantic Fleet.[1]\\nThe Egyptian Expedition in June and July 1882 was a response by the United States to the British and French attack on Alexandria during the Anglo-Egyptian War. To protect American citizens and their property within the city, ships of the European Squadron, under Rear Admiral James Nicholson, were sent to Egypt with orders to observe the conflict ashore and make a landing if necessary. British and French forces heavily damaged the city and started a large fire so a force of marines and sailors were landed and they assisted in fire fighting and guarding the American consulate from insurgents.[2]\\nCasper F. Goodrich, who served as an executive officer on the USS Lancaster, commanded the landing party and would later publish an extensive report on the bombardment.[3]\\nThe European Squadron returned to U.S. waters at the start of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, and did not return to Europe until July 1901, when Admiral Bartlett J.

From 1956 until he was appointed Rebbe, he was a Rosh Yeshiva. He also served as a member and the president of the Torah Scholars Council and as the Chairman of the Agudat Yisrael political party.[1]\\nPinchas Menachem was born in Falenica, near Warsaw, Poland. He was the only offspring of the second marriage of his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, the fourth Rebbe of Ger, to Feyge Mintshe Biderman. Pinchas Menachem had four half-brothers and two half-sisters from his father\\'s first marriage—including the fifth Rebbe of Ger, Rabbi Yisrael Alter, and Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, the sixth Rebbe of Ger.\\nPinchas Menachem\\'s bar mitzva took place near Ludmir in Poland (now western Ukraine) not long before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. After the war, he married his cousin, Tzipora Alter. In 1956, he was appointed rosh yeshiva of Sfas Emes, the flagship yeshiva of Ger in Jerusalem, Israel.\\nRabbi Pinchas Menachem succeeded his half-brother, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, to become Rebbe in 1992. His position as rosh yeshiva of Sfas Emes Yeshiva was assumed by his son, Rabbi Shaul Alter, who is widely regarded as an eminent Talmudic scholar.\\nDuring his tenure, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem continued the policies of his half-brothers, Rabbi Simcha Bunim and Rabbi Yisrael, by supporting the political work of the Agudat Israel of Israel party, promoting the interests of Haredi Judaism in the Israeli Knesset. He reached a rapprochement with his non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi fellow-rabbis, in particular with Rabbi Elazar Shach, leader of the rival Degel HaTorah party. Together, they created the United Torah Judaism (Yahadut HaTorah) party in order not to lose residual votes in the Israeli proportional representation system, and thereby potentially obtain an extra seat for the newly united party in Knesset elections.\\nRabbi Pinchas Menachem died in 1996 after less than four years at the helm of the Ger dynasty. He was buried beside his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, in the courtyard of the Sfas Emes Yeshiva. Unlike his father\\'s grave, which was dug by hand under the cover of darkness during the British curfew in 1948, the Pnei Menachem\\'s grave was dug with machinery; the latter grave is therefore lower than the former.[2] A red-brick ohel was built over the two graves, which are visited frequently by students in the yeshiva.[2]\\nHe was succeeded as Rebbe by his nephew, Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter, son of Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter.\\nIn 2019 his son Rabbi Shaul Alter formed his own followership of Ger Chasidim called Kehilas Pnei Menachem which is independent of the greater Ger sect.\\nBixin is an apocarotenoid found in the seeds of the achiote tree (Bixa orellana)[2] from which it derives its name. It is commonly extracted from the seeds to form annatto, a natural food coloring, containing about 5% pigments of which 70-80% are bixin.[3]\\nBixin is chemically unstable when isolated and converts via isomerization into trans-bixin (β-bixin), the double-bond isomer.[1]\\nBixin is soluble in fats and alcohols but insoluble in water.

The chapter is named \\'Al-Infitar\\' because of the occurrence of the word \\'unfatarat\\' in the first verse of this chapter. Infitar means \\'split asunder\\': the word \\'Unfatarat\\' is used in this chapter in order to describe the splitting of the sky on the day of Judgment.

The son of Jørn Utzon, with whom he worked closely on several prestigious projects, he has completed a number of fine works of his own including the Performing Arts Centre in Esbjerg.[1][2]\\nBorn on 27 September 1944 in Stockholm, Utzon was brought up first at Hellebæk near Helsingør in the north of Zealand until the family moved to Australia in 1957. He studied at the School of Architecture in Sydney (1964–66) and at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen (1966–1970).\\nDeeply influenced by his father\\'s approach to architecture, Jan Utzon soon began to collaborate with him taking on key supervisory tasks in major projects such as the Kuwait National Assembly Building. In many cases, it is difficult to estimate to division of responsibility in projects undertaken by Utzon Associates where Jan worked both with his father and his brother Kim. These include the Paustian House in Copenhagen and the Skagen Odde Nature Centre in the north of Jutland. Jan also set up his own design office on Funen where he authored many interesting projects. One of his most successful is the Performing Arts Centre in Esbjerg (1997) with its theatre and concert hall combined with the earlier art museum. Its large communal foyer catering both to the concert hall and the museum is particularly appealing and was achieved on a modest budget.[3]\\nUtzon Architects and Johnson Pilton Walker, Architects in collaboration, have explored options to improve the existing Opera Theatre at the Sydney Opera House.\\nUtzon has also been active in the developing countries.

They have appeared in Uncanny X-Men within the Marvel Comics universe. They were created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum. Many of them were enslaved by the Brood empire.\\nThe Acanti roughly resemble whales. They are a reddish-brown color. They have dorsal, ventral, lateral, and caudal fins, as well as green eyes widely spaced on their heads. The Acanti are large space-faring creatures most closely resembling Earth\\'s whale shark. An adult Acanti can grow to a few kilometers in length, and even an infant is large enough to swallow a 15-person spaceship with room to take in at least four more. They are sentient creatures which communicate through psionic sounds referred to as songs. Acanti have the innate ability to fly faster than the speed of light, without technological assistance.\\nAccording to myth, the Acanti are an ancient species which peacefully wandered through space, benevolent and compassionate by nature. The Acanti were led by one individual known as the Prophet-Singer. The Prophet-Singer was the repository of the Acanti\\'s racial Soul, a collective semi-mystical force that linked and motivated the Acanti species. As death approached, the Acanti typically hurled themselves into stars. The Prophet-Singer of each generation would also do so, releasing the Soul to join the body of the next Prophet-Singer.\\nUpon migrating to the Milky Way galaxy, the Brood began to enslave the Acanti to take advantage of their natural ability to travel at speeds exceeding light. The Brood would infect individual Acanti with a disease known as the Slaver Virus, which would destroy the higher cognitive functions of their minds, making them ripe for easy control. Then, the Brood would transform the mindless husks into living starships. The Brood succeeded in enslaving the Acanti Prophet-Singer, and when he eventually died and crashed on a planet, its body was reconstructed as the \"throne city\" (presumably like a capital) on the planet (referred to as \"Broodworld\" or \"Sleazeworld\") that the Brood then established as the center of their empire. Thus, the Soul remained trapped in the skull of the dead Prophet-Singer.\\nSalvation for the Acanti came when a new Prophet-Singer was born, however, without transferring the soul to him, the Acanti were still stuck near Sleazeworld. During the X-Men\\'s first conflict with the Brood the X-Men had been abducted and infected by the Brood and brought to their homeworld. Carol Danvers (formerly Ms. Marvel) became linked with a white hole and transformed into Binary. The process made her temporarily insane, and she blasted out of Lilandra\\'s yacht, causing an explosive decompression that sucked Storm into space, where she was found by the newborn Prophet-Singer, whose mother had just been enslaved by the Brood. Storm herself was now becoming a Brood as the egg began to hatch. The Prophet-Singer saved Storm (who had destroyed the egg and critically wounded herself).[1] Other Acanti merged Storm\\'s consciousness with that of the Prophet-Singer while Storm\\'s body healed in a cocoon within him.\\nThe Acanti saved Storm, entering into a symbiotic relationship in which the Acanti healed Storm\\'s body, purging it of the Brood embryo, and Storm\\'s experienced mind provided a source of focus and strength for the baby Prophet-Singer. The Acanti then swallowed Liliandra\\'s yacht, masking it from Brood sensors while the crew effected repairs.[1]\\nThe X-Men then agreed to release the Soul from Broodworld. After a battle against the Brood, Binary succeeded in releasing the Soul from the crystalline room in which it was trapped. The foul nature of the Brood Queen and the embryos within the X-Men immediately resonated as black pools throughout the chamber. The grateful Soul purged the X-Men of the Brood embryos and transformed the Brood Queen into pure inanimate crystal. The Soul united with the young Prophet-Singer, who assumed leadership of the Acanti.[2]\\nRecently, however, the Brood attempted to invade Earth using a fleet of Acanti ships, though ones without external domes. It is unknown whether these were leftovers from before the X-Men freed the Prophet-Singer, or whether the Brood have continued their depredations on the Acanti even afterwards. The fleet was scared away from Earth with a telepathic illusion of the Phoenix Force and Galactus.\\nOne Acanti was obtained by Roxxon Energy Corporation. With a riding device added to it, the Acanti was controlled by an unidentified Brood-infected human working for Dario Agger in his plot to hire Weapon H into working for Roxxon. Weapon H used his punch to defeat the Acanti.[3]\\nAlthough not named, in the Ultimate Fantastic Four #35 (Dec. 2006)\\nthere is a huge alien creature, used by the Acheron Empire, ruled by Thanos, that resembles the Acanti.\\nAn Acanti appears in the X-Men episode \"Love in Vain\". Enslaved by the Brood (here called \"The Colony\") to be their vessel, it is freed when Professor X uses his psychic powers to break the Brood\\'s control. The Brood cannot stand the Acanti\\'s song while the X-Man Rogue finds it beautiful.\\nRen (Katherine) Powell (born Karen Lee Tudor in Anaheim, California) is an American-born Norwegian poet and translator.\\nPowell has translated more than a dozen book-length publications for various publishers.

It is located on the Rio Ruidoso and U.S. Highway 70, between the communities of Hondo and Glencoe. It is just east of the Lincoln National Forest.\\nThe community is the site of San Patricio Retreat Center, a Benedictine spirituality center recently purchased by the Diocese of Las Cruces, New Mexico.[1] The Hurd-LaRinconada Gallery, owned by artist Michael Hurd, is located here. The gallery displays original works of art by the Wyeth and Hurd families and there are guest houses on the ranch.\\nIn the 1850s, Hispanic settlers moved to the area, which caused conflict with the native Apache. According to an interview with Frank Coe, these settlers lived in placitas, or \"adobe family compounds enclosed for defensive purposes.\"  Some still survive in the 21st century. Historic documents collected by the New Mexico Department of Transportation note:[2]\\nIn his book Frontier Fighter, George Coe describes the late 1800s houses in San Patricio as being \"built for defense with thick adobe walls and portholes on top.\" Robery Utley\\'s book High Noon in Lincoln describes San Patricio in the 1870s as made up of \"some 15 adobe buildings scattered along a single street.\"[2]In the following decades, European-American settlers began to move here as well. The town was estimated to have about 40 families in 1867. That year the first acequia in the Hondo Valley was dug in San Patricio.[2]\\nAround 1870, the town was named Ruidoso after the nearby river. Several years later it was renamed after a Catholic church built here: La Iglesia de San Patricio.[2][3] This church, also known as the San Patricio Catholic Church, was the first church in the area. It became an important cultural center for the residents.[2] Similar churches of this type are found throughout the Hondo Valley.\\nSan Patricio was the site of a battle in the Lincoln County War. It was associated with Billy the Kid, who attended dances in town during the 1870s. In 1878, James Dolan and his allies, including the Rio Grande Posse, vandalized the town and stole and killed horses.[3]\\nBy the 1920s, the population grew to 822. Artists Peter Hurd and his wife Henriette Wyeth moved to the area in the 1930s, starting a farm of 40 acres. They were the first among numerous artists to live in the area and eventually had a 2200-acre ranch.\\nDuring World War II the population declined. Postwar development followed highway construction, and businesses moved to follow the changing path of U.S. Route 70.[3]\\nIn 1967, St. Jude\\'s Church was built, consolidating the congregations of all nearby Catholic churches in the Hondo Valley.[2]\\nThe coordinates of San Patricio are 33°24′32″N 105°19′37″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff33.40889°N 105.32694°W\\ufeff / 33.40889; -105.32694 (33.408976, -105.326928).[4]\\nThe elevation is 5436 feet (1657\\xa0m).\\nSan Patricio is located near the confluence of Rio Ruidoso and Rio Bonito. Glencoe is to the west and Hondo to the east. After their confluence, the rivers become the Rio Hondo.[2]\\nThe Catholic community in Glencoe attends St. Jude\\'s Church in San Patricio.[5] This church incorporated the bells from the historical Glencoe and Hondo Catholic churches, and San Patricio Church.[2]\\nU.S. Route 70 serves the town, which is a 16.5 mile drive from Sierra Blanca Regional Airport.\\nThe community and region are known for growing apples;[6] the orchards were a major part of the economy until the mid-1900s. Other orchard fruits, like peaches, pears, and cherries, and more general agricultural products were also sold to truckers along with the apples.\\nFloods in 1941 and 1965, and the threat of cold weather have been the main dangers to these orchards. Early businesses of San Patricio included a general store, a grocery shop, a bar, a pool hall, a post office, and a gas station. In the early 2000s, only the post office is still operating.[2]\\nSan Patricio built its first school before 1880. The school district included 70 students in 1880 and 153 in 1920. The four-room elementary school closed in 1960 after the smaller school districts in the area consolidated to Hondo\\'s elementary school.\\nBride and Groom is an old-time radio human-interest program in the United States. It was broadcast on ABC from November 26, 1945 to September 15, 1950.[1] Each episode featured an engaged couple who would be married during the broadcast, then showered with gifts.\\nIn 1951, it was adapted as a television show of the same name.\\nEach episode centred on a couple engaged to be married. An episode would begin with host John Nelson interviewing the couple, with questions about how the two met and their courtship.[2] Announcer Jack McElroy would sing a song for the couple, who would then exit to an adjacent chapel to be married by one of around 30 clergymen retained by the show. During the wedding ceremony, which was not recorded, Nelson would chat with members of the audience. He would usually speak with married couples who were celebrating significant anniversary milestones, who would be given gifts such as matching wristwatches.[3] After the ceremony, the newlyweds returned to the studio where they received wedding gifts provided by sponsors, such as refrigerators, stoves, silverware and jewelry, as a reward for participating in the program.[4]\\nThe 30-minute program was sponsored by Sterling Drug until January 2, 1950.[5]\\nRadio historian John Dunning wrote, \"During its five-year run, Bride and Groom told the stories of almost 1,000 new couples.\"[1] Couples who were ready to marry provided information about themselves to the show\\'s staff. Applications were reviewed by director John Reddy or a panel of judges.\\nAs a matter of policy, the show excluded divorcees from consideration. Roman Catholic couples were also not cast because their faith would have required them to be married in a Catholic church. Couples married on the show ranged in age from teenagers to octogenarians. On occasion, the show featured celebrity couples, such as radio personality Bud Collyer and actress Marian Shockley in 1948.[3]\\nJohn Nelson was the program\\'s host, while Jack McElroy was the announcer.[2] Music was by Gaylord Carter.[6] Edward Feldman[7] and John Masterson were the directors,[8]:\\u200a823\\u200a and John Reddy was the writer.[8]\\n\\nThis article about a radio show or program in the United States is a stub.

Her adversarial relationship with Neville blossoms into a love affair.\\nAlan Plater had begun writing for television in the early 1960s and had been a regular writer on the police series Z-Cars (1962–78) and its spin-off series Softly, Softly (1966–69) and Softly, Softly: Taskforce (1969–76). He had also written several plays for the BBC and ITV and created and wrote the sitcom Oh No, It\\'s Selwyn Froggitt! (1974). Plater\\'s scripts were noted for their strong depiction of the lives of the inhabitants of Northern England. In 1978, Plater was commissioned by David Cunliffe, an executive producer at Yorkshire Television (YTV), to adapt J. B. Priestley\\'s The Good Companions as a thirteen part serial. Plater was only able to stretch the plot to fill nine episodes and so offered to write four episodes of what he called a \"non-violent thriller\" to make up the balance.\\nUsing characters inspired by Nick and Nora Charles, the detectives in the film The Thin Man (1934) and its sequels, Plater sought to juxtapose the conventions of the hardboiled thriller, as expounded by the likes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, with the mundanity of life in Yorkshire. The plot was inspired by a newspaper article that reported that 20,000 people went missing in the UK each year.\\nIn creating his two protagonists – Neville Keaton and Judy Threadgold (named after Sunderland goalkeeper Harry Threadgold) – Plater hit upon the idea of making them schoolteachers, saying, \"I tried to think of the least likely place to find two detectives and I came up with a staffroom of a comprehensive school in Leeds\". Plater apportioned elements of his own interests to his two heroes, making Judy an environmental campaigner and Neville a football and jazz fan. Neville\\'s love of jazz is reflected in the serial\\'s soundtrack which features re-recordings, by Frank Ricotti and featuring Kenny Baker, of tracks by the likes of Duke Ellington.\\nCast as Neville Keaton was Alun Armstrong who, at the time, had worked with the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company and would later go on to enjoy a varied television career with roles in such programmes as Our Friends in the North (1996), This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper (2000) and New Tricks (2003–2013).\\nJudy Threadgold was played by Bridget Turner, an actress best known for her stage work, especially works by Alan Ayckbourn, and had previously appeared in episodes of Sutherland\\'s Law (1973–76) and Target (1977–78).\\nThe series was mainly filmed around the Leeds area.  Settings included:\\nGet Lost! aired to respectable ratings – averaging 10.9 million viewers across its run – and Plater soon began work on a sequel. When it transpired than Alun Armstrong would not be available to reprise the role of Neville Keaton, Plater decided that, rather than recasting the role, he would create two new characters and rewrite the scripts. The sequel to Get Lost!  was reworked by Plater into what was to become The Beiderbecke Affair (1985), the first serial in what was to become known as The Beiderbecke Trilogy.\\nGet Lost! was released on region 2 DVD by Network in 2006 as an extra in a box-set release of The Beiderbecke Trilogy.\\nThe Moscow Jewish Film Festival is an annual international film festival, which aims to gather in the program features, documentaries, shorts and animated films on the subject of Jewish culture, history and national identity and contemporary problems.[1] In 2015, Moscow joined a list of cities that celebrate this festival.[2]\\nThe first Moscow Jewish Film Festival was held from June 14 to 17, 2015, at Moscow\\'s Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, a Documentary film center and cinema GUM.

Most of the films presented at the festival were shown in Russia for the first time. Most part of the festival screenings are Russian premieres of the films.\\nWe gladly support the Moscow Jewish Film Festival and are determined to extend this partnership, for we consider it to be important not only for the Russian Jewish Community, but for the country as a whole. The Festivals contributes significantly into establishing peace between nations and confessions.[42]Films that talk about Jewish themes are a great contribution into dialogue between cultures, which is undoubtedly important for a multinational country that Russia is.[43]Charlene Drew Jarvis (born July 31, 1941 in Washington, D.C.[3] as Charlene Rosella Drew) is an American educator and former scientific researcher and politician who served as the president of Southeastern University until March 31, 2009.[4] Jarvis is the daughter of the blood plasma and blood transfusion pioneer Charles Drew.[5]\\nJarvis earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College in 1962, a Master of Science degree in psychology from Howard University in 1964, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in neuropsychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1971.[3][6]\\nWard 4\\'s representative to the Council of the District of Columbia, Arrington Dixon, won the election for chairman of the council in November 1978, leaving the Ward 4 seat vacant.

Upham as the gesture that was to accompany the American Pledge of Allegiance, which had been written by Francis Bellamy. It was also known as the \"flag salute\" during the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance. Bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. Both the Pledge and its salute originated in 1892. Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, Italian fascists and Nazi Germans adopted a salute which was very similar, erroneously attributed to the Roman salute, a gesture that was popularly believed to have been used in ancient Rome.[1] This resulted in controversy over the use of the Bellamy salute in the United States. It was officially replaced by the hand-over-heart salute when Congress amended the Flag Code on December 22, 1942.\\nThe inventor of the Bellamy salute was James B. Upham, junior partner and editor of The Youth\\'s Companion.[2] Bellamy recalled that Upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said, \"Now up there is the flag; I come to salute; as I say \"I pledge allegiance to my flag,\" I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow.\"[2]\\nThe Bellamy salute was first demonstrated on October 12, 1892, according to Bellamy\\'s published instructions for the \"National School Celebration of Columbus Day\":\\nAt a signal from the Principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the Flag. Another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute – right hand lifted, palm downward, to align with the forehead and close to it. Standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, \"I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands; one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.\" At the words, \"to my Flag,\" the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the Flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side.In the 1920s, Italian fascists adopted what has been called the Roman salute to symbolize their claim to have revitalized Italy on the model of ancient Rome. A similar ritual was adopted by the German Nazis, creating the Nazi salute. Controversy grew in the United States on the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes. School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity. There was a counter-backlash from the United States Flag Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution, who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture.[3]\\nFrom 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, detractors of Americans who argued against intervention in World War II produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those Americans\\' reputations. Among the anti-interventionist Americans was aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh. The pictures of him appearing to do the Nazi salute are actually pictures of him using the Bellamy salute.[4] In his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Lindbergh (1998), author A. Scott Berg explains that interventionist propagandists would photograph Lindbergh and other isolationists using this salute from an angle that left out the American flag, so it would be indistinguishable to observers from the Nazi salute.\\nOn June 22, 1942, at the urging of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Congress passed Public Law 77-623, which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. This included the use of a palm-out salute, specifically that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words \\'to the flag\\' and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.\" Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. Congress later amended the code on December 22, 1942, when it passed Public Law 77-829, stating among other changes, that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.\"[5]\\n\\nThe 1971–72 season was the 48th season in the existence of AEK Athens F.C. and the 13th consecutive season in the top flight of Greek football. They competed in the Alpha Ethniki, the Greek Cup and the European Cup. The season began on 29 August 1971 and finished on 11 June 1972.\\nAfter the distinctions of the previous years, AEK seemed to operate in a \"frantic tempo\", until this season, which was the passing to a declining period for the team. The team\\'s roster was constantly renewed as a generation of players left, passing the torch to the next one. The new generation was consisted of great and talented players, however the club was not ready to claim a leading role in the league. AEK participated in the European Cup. The draw was tough for AEK, as from the very first round faced one of the greastest European clubs over time, the great Internazionale of Ivano Bordon, Giacinto Facchetti and Sandro Mazzola. The first match at San Siro in front of almost 80,000 spectators, AEK managed to take the lead at the 14th minute with Pomonis, but Inter\\'s superiority was obvious and after equalizing 5 minutes later, they finished the first half leading by 3–1. The second half turned out to be a standard procedure with Inter raising the score to 4–1 and likewise the few chances of AEK qualifying disappeared. In the rematch at the crowded AEK Stadium no one expected what was about to happen. Everything started wrong for the yellow-blacks, as they were left behind the score at the 17th minute with a goal by Mazzola. Bertini\\'s dismissal two minutes later and Stankovic\\'s offensive style, brought AEK in taking the lead at the half time with Ventouris and Papaioannou, while also having two shoots hit the post. The Italians, wanting if nothing else not to lose, chased the goal and equalized with Boninsegna at the 76th minute. The players of AEK, realizing that the qualification was lost definitively, sought the victory and achieved it with a goal by Nikolaidis at the 89th minute, that made the final 3–2. One of the greatest victories for the then \"poor\" Greek football and the first great European night for AEK. In the league they finished third with 6 points from the top. This season was one of the worst for the club\\'s history for the Greek Cup. A very important year for the development of the tournament, as the amateur teams of the local legal associations cease to participate and only the teams of the national divisions could participate. The ties of the first round competed again according to geographical criteria, while from the second round onwards the draw was free. AEK easily overcame PAO Rouf in the First Round and Kozani in the Second Round, but in the Round of 16 they faced Lamia, who to everyone\\'s surprise, eliminated them with 1–0 at the extra time.[1]\\nNOTE: The players are the ones that have been announced by the AEK Athens\\' press release.

Described by critic Scott Yanow as \"the definitive swing pianist\",[2] Wilson had a sophisticated, elegant style. His work was featured on the records of many of the biggest names in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. With Goodman, he was one of the first black musicians to appear prominently with white musicians. In addition to his extensive work as a sideman, Wilson also led his own groups and recording sessions from the late 1920s to the 1980s.\\nWilson was born in Austin, Texas.[3] He studied piano and violin at Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama.[3] After working in Speed Webb\\'s band, with Louis Armstrong, and also understudying Earl Hines in Hines\\'s Grand Terrace Cafe Orchestra, Wilson joined Benny Carter\\'s Chocolate Dandies in 1933.[3] In 1935, he joined the Benny Goodman Trio (which consisted of Goodman, Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa, later expanded to the Benny Goodman Quartet with the addition of Lionel Hampton).[3] The trio performed during the big band\\'s intermissions. By joining the trio, Wilson became one of the first black musicians to perform prominently in a racially integrated group.\\nJazz producer and writer John Hammond was instrumental in getting Wilson a contract with Brunswick, starting in 1935, to record hot swing arrangements of the popular songs of the day, with the growing jukebox trade in mind. He recorded hit records with singers such as Lena Horne, Helen Ward and Billie Holiday. During these years, he also took part in many sessions with swing musicians such as Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers, Red Norvo, Buck Clayton, and Ben Webster. From 1936 to 1942, he recorded for Brunswick Records and Columbia Records. In the 1950s he recorded on Verve Records.\\nWilson formed his own short-lived big band in 1939, then led a sextet at Café Society from 1940 to 1944.[3] He was dubbed the \"Marxist Mozart\" by Howard \"Stretch\" Johnson due to his support for left-wing causes: he performed in benefit concerts for The New Masses journal and for Russian War Relief, and he chaired the Artists\\' Committee to elect Benjamin J. Davis (a New York City council member running on the Communist Party USA ballot line).[4] In the 1950s, Wilson taught at the Juilliard School. Wilson can be seen appearing as himself in the motion pictures Hollywood Hotel (1937) and The Benny Goodman Story (1955). He also worked as music director for the Dick Cavett Show.\\nWilson lived quietly in suburban Hillsdale, New Jersey.[5] He was married three times, including to the songwriter Irene Kitchings. He performed as a soloist and with pickup groups until the final years of his life, including leading a trio with his sons Theodore Wilson on bass and Steven Wilson on drums.[6]\\nIn 1979, Wilson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.[7]\\nWilson died of stomach cancer in New Britain, Connecticut, on July 31, 1986, aged 73.

He is well known for his murals created on Mohamed Mahmoud Street in Cairo, Egypt in 2012 during the Egyptian Revolution, which took media attention. His public murals and paintings encompass the history, dignity and charisma of the Egyptian people. He has worked internationally, in both solo exhibitions for his oil paintings and outdoor public murals.[1]\\nAwad began his collegiate studies at South Valley University, Faculty of Fine Arts in Luxor, Egypt and graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts. Afterwards, he began his masters studies at Helwan University, College of Fine Arts in Zamalek, Egypt, while at the same time serving as an assistant lecturer for South Valley University, Faculty of Fine Arts in Luxor Egypt. During these years, Awad spent time between both universities and graduated with a Master of Arts in 2012.\\nCurrently, he is a PhD candidate and serves as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Mural Painting, for the Faculty of Fine Arts, at South Valley University in Luxor, Egypt.[2] His murals and public art became well known in late 2011 and early 2012 after he took a break from teaching to paint a mural in Cairo, in this moment the Port Said Massacre unfolded which changed the course of his plans and shifted his mural into a memorial mural.[2] What was meant to only be a short period of time in Cairo became a much longer time for Awad as he continued to paint new murals on Mohamed Mahmoud Street in Cairo.[3]\\nAwad\\'s PhD dissertation working title is, \"Artistic Vision Inspired by The Murals of War and Peace in Ancient Egyptian Art\" and is expected to be released in 2019.[3]\\nIn regards to his murals, Alaa chooses to paint with a brush and uses acrylic paints rather than using stencils and spray paints.[4] His intricate paintings can sometimes take up to a week to complete, not only because of the materials he uses, but because of the complexity of his designs. Awad paints in a neo-pharonic style, a style that harkens back to Ancient Egypt. His usage of the neo-pharonic style is meant to draw attention back to the rich, old Egyptian traditions.[2] This style aims to remind the Egyptian people of their heritage and past, a reminder to stay true to their Egyptian identity.[5] His murals are typically multifaceted and multi-layered with each telling a different story.\\nBeyond the aforementioned unique style of painting, using a neo-pharaonic style aims to return the prominence of public murals in Egypt. Public murals have played a significant role in Egyptian villages in the past, when each village had their own muralist.[6] These muralists would essentially be storytellers of the village and would depict important events or celebrations through traditional imagery and symbolism.[6] Many of these same images can be seen in Awad\\'s artwork today as he is inspired from the famous works of art from Ancient Egypt that may be seen in temples and museums.\\nAlaa Awad is also inspired by other ancient Egyptian intangible heritage forms still found in Upper Egypt such as Tahtib (Egyptian Arabic: تحطيب taḥṭīb), El Mormah and the daily life of the West Bank in Luxor, Egypt.\\nAlaa Awad\\'s public murals were created in Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution and were painted on significant walls including temporary wall-like roadblock, built to keep protesters away from government buildings. In total, eight walls and seven roadblocks were constructed to keep protesters from Tahrir Square away from the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Justice, and Parliament House.[7] The paintings along Mohamed Mahmoud Street reflect the juxtaposition between the ruling power and how their style of leadership has fueled the resistance.[6] A major difference between Awad\\'s public murals and the other street art is that Awad\\'s art is much more subtle because of the neo-pharonic style of his works. While his works will oftentimes directly tie to a social issue, such as gas tank shortages or women\\'s rights, an underlying theme is that Egyptians as a whole must remember their past culture and history stating that \"we can\\'t know our future if we forget our past.\"[4] Awad himself has indicated his own political beliefs stating that \"I don\\'t see any change in Egypt\\'s politics, inside or out. I just see that the Muslim Brotherhood has captured the government. They want to change everything according to their own style, to make everything Muslim Brotherhood. They forget to improve things for the public. They have forgotten the people.\"[4]\\nThe Victory Mosaic was designed by Awad in Luxor, Egypt and was constructed with a team under the direction of Awad.  The team consisted of students and instructors from South Valley University, Faculty of Fine Arts, Department of Mural Painting. It was inspired from the battle scenes found in Ancient Egyptian site Habu Temple. The material used to construct the mosaic was mosaic and glass. The approximate size is 6 x 4.8 meters. It was installed in late November 2017 on the sports hall building of South Valley University campus in Qena, Egypt. The mosaic took one year to complete.\\nMarching Women is a mural which consists of two main components, \"women in the funeral march\" and \"women climb the ladder\". This work is based on an original image in the Ramesseum temple in West Bank of Luxor, a photo of engraved battle scenes on the Ramesseum\\'s First Pylon, Thebes. The Ramesseum has some of the Egyptian world\\'s oldest surviving pylons. A pylon, or monumental portal to an ancient Egyptian temple, usually consists of two massive upward tapering walls flanking and perpendicular to the temples entrance. Awad changed it, his painting made women instead of men apparent to the viewer. This work shows the strong role that women played in society in the past of Egypt and today. And we can see his meaning in the women\\'s hands—they have papyrus in their hands, this communicates the meaning of knowledge .\\nThis work, Women Climbing the Ladder, was based on a scene located at the Ramesseum Temple in Luxor, Egypt. By placing this ancient image in a more modern context it demonstrates how instrumental women were in the past and also in the present.[19] Awad painted this piece to represent the role of women and stated the influence of the battle of Kadesh in which it is located. In this court are well preserved scenes from the battle of Kadesh. Ramesses II dashes into battle (lower row). He is depicted larger than his men, and the enemy, mostly dead and wounded, lie in heaps on the ground. The fortress of Kadesh, surrounded by a moat, divides a group of the enemy from the battlefield. These men, far from preparing themselves for battle, are lending a hand to their drowning companions. Though this mural has been considered by some as a pretentious interpretation, there is no doubt that the complexity of the composition shows development and sophistication. The individual figures, however, indicate marked deterioration from the expressive detail of the murals of Seti I\\'s mortuary temple. Egypt has a long history and its own traditions.[2] This again highlights Awad bringing social issues into the limelight while also reinforcing that Egypt must return to its roots to move ahead.\\nOn Mohamed Mahmoud street is an extensive image of mural paintings inspired by ancient Egyptian history, painted by Awad in 2012. \"The myth of human destruction in ancient egypt\" with hieroglyphic written by Amir Fouad. In fact, however, history as cultural and social memory could not be more alive in the Egyptian Revolution and its aftermath. The Egyptian Revolution has reinvigorated history on the street in a way that has the capacity to produce change in society. The most intangible evidence of this is in the street murals of Mohammad Mahmoud Street, which incorporated Egyptian art in a way that endows both ancient and modern history with positive meanings. This image was expanded upon by Awad by painting a series of hostesses, or \"ladies-in-waiting,\" which was meant to \"portray a centuries\" old feminine wisdom with a welcoming smile. This image shows the kindness of the hostess, representing the people, juxtaposed. The position of this figures inspire by the position of the figures unfinished in Tomb of Ramose.\\nAll Night It Is Morning by Andy Young, November 2014[20]\\nSoft Force: Women in Egypt\\'s Islamic Awakening by Ellen Anne McLarney .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}ISBN\\xa09780691158488, 9780691158495, 9781400866441, 2015[21]\\nDaughters of the Nile: Egyptian Women Changing Their World by Samia I.

Bharathan himself composed the title song, while the rest of the songs and background score were composed by Ouseppachan.[citation needed]\\nThe movie is about a young man Louis who is taken in by the central woman protagonist Marykutty, who herself is a victim of an abusive marriage.\\nLouis arrives at a village and leaps out of the lorry to relieve himself. The lorry driver, thinking he got down, drives away. Louis runs behind but the lorry drives away. He is stranded and is desperate for money. Mary Kutty comes walking by. She allows him to stay at her residence. A storm rages all night and the roof of the house is damaged. The next day, Louis, along with Kuttan, fix the roof. Teresa, Mary\\'s sister comes there to visit Mary. She is a nun at a local convent. years ago, their father, Paily left home for some unknown reason. Lazar, a driver, then forcibly marries  Mary. They then have a child. Lazar now lusts after Teresa. To escape his cruelty, Mary pleads with Teresa to go away. Teresa and Mary now are under the care of Achan. But Lazar, now poisoned by Rappayi, comes and extorts money from Mary every month.[1]\\nAchan also comes and sees the newcomer Louis. He asks Louis to come to the church to do some repair work. Louis, a gifted musician, plays the organ/piano at the church. Achan quietly watches this and then applauds Louis. He asks Louis to write music for Achan\\'s compositions, which is to be sent to other places as cassettes. Louis does excellent work, which Mary likes and is now starting to like Louis. Rappayi, who is also the Kappiyaar(Bellman) reports everything and emphasizes that Mary and Louis are having an affair. Lazar, intoxicated, rushes to Mary and a brawl breaks out between Louis and Lazar. Lazar says that Louis will die by his hands.\\nPaily returns and acknowledges Louis as a good man. Both daughters are in tears as their father has returned.

As of 2014, it has around 500 registered golfers.[1]\\nIn 1996, Haruhisa Handa who was the founder of Japanese Blind Golf Association appealed to blind golf associations around the world to set up a governing organization.  In 1997, the World Blind Golfers Conference was held in Perth, Australia, where representatives from six countries participated to propose the articles of association and handicap system.  In 1998, the proposal was resolved at a meeting held during the 5th Blind Golf World Championship in Florida, US, so that a global governing organization could be established.  Handa was elected as the first president, and David Blyth from Australia became the first chairman (responsible in administration).[2][3][4]\\nThere were eight organizations that took part in the World Blind Golfers’ Conference held in 1997 from 6 countries; Japan, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.[4]\\nAs of 2014, International Blind Golf Association has 18 member organizations from 16 countries including 4 associate organizations from 4 countries.\\nNotes\\n\\n\"The Hunger Strike\" is a second-season episode of the Adult Swim animated television series The Boondocks. It was set to premiere on January 7, 2008, between \"The Story of Thugnificent\" and \"Attack of the Killer Kung-Fu Wolf Bitch\", but did not air in the United States until May 29, 2020.[1] In Canada, the episode was aired on March 16, 2008, on the network Teletoon at Night,  with a disclaimer stating that \"the views in this program do not reflect that of Teletoon Canada or its parent companies\". The episode also aired globally elsewhere, and appeared on Netflix streaming in Canada, as well as on HBO Max in the United States shortly before its TV premiere. According to Aaron McGruder on an introduction video for the episode found on the DVD set, this episode was originally set to be titled \"BET Sucks\".\\nAt the headquarters of BET, fictional president Debra Leevil (a parody of BET Holdings CEO Debra L. Lee with a personality resembling Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers films) presides over a board meeting to discuss the network\\'s strategy for destroying black people. The issue of Huey Freeman is brought up, as he is shown on CNN giving a press conference stating that he is on a hunger strike and that he will not eat until there is a public apology for creating BET, the network is shut down, and all the executive board members commit seppuku.\\nHuey joins forces with the charismatic Rev. Rollo Goodlove (voiced by rapper/singer Cee-Lo), who adds a flashy image to the fight against BET by lobbying for a boycott of the network. Huey initially believes this to be a good idea, as a concert organized by Goodlove (and featuring his band) draws widespread attention and sparks a widespread boycott. However, Huey gradually discovers that Goodlove is primarily interested in drawing media attention to himself through shameless merchandising, self-promotion, and outrageous behavior. Goodlove justifies his tactics by explaining that in order to reach the black community, he has to present its members with something they can relate to.\\nLeevil and the BET board eventually see a news broadcast in which Uncle Ruckus expresses his support of BET and its ability to ruin the minds of young black people. Taking inspiration from his words, they offer Goodlove a sitcom on the network; he accepts, betraying Huey and causing the boycott to fall apart. Huey ends his hunger strike and asks his grandfather Robert, \"What do you do when you can\\'t do nothing, but there\\'s nothing you can do?\" \"You do what you can,\" Robert says.\\nThere have been rumors that this and a second episode (\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\") were initially banned from airing in the U.S. due to threatened litigation from BET.[2] The episodes are said to specifically attack Reggie Hudlin, BET\\'s president of entertainment from 2005 to 2008, and Debra L. Lee, president and chief executive officer of BET Holdings (parent company of BET). Lee is portrayed as Deborah Leevil, a parody of the character Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, and Hudlin is portrayed as Wedgie Rudlin, a \"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his Ivy League education.\" However, a Cartoon Network representative stated that BET had not contacted Cartoon Network regarding the episodes.[3] Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter.\\nIronically, Hudlin was credited as an executive producer for the first two seasons of The Boondocks, though this was only a contractual obligation; Hudlin had no involvement with the show since the first pilot was rejected by Fox.[2] During the episode, the character Deborah Leevil relates the mission of BET within The Boondocks universe, stating:\\nOur leader Bob Johnson had a dream, a dream creating a network that would accomplish what hundreds of years of slavery, Jim Crow and malt liquor couldn\\'t – the destruction of black people![2]On the DVD release of the second season, McGruder states \"I was looking for changes and improvements, and I didn\\'t see any.\" referring to BET\\'s programming. He decided to show his frustration using satire in The Boondocks, reasoning \"I didn\\'t see them. So I said, OK, it\\'s fair game.\"[2]\\n Bongoulou  is a village in the Bassar Prefecture in the Kara Region  of north-western Togo.[1]\\n\\nThis Kara Region location article is a stub.

Given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of word-sense disambiguation (WSD), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the ambiguity of words in context.\\nThe output of a word-sense induction algorithm is a clustering of contexts in which the target word occurs or a clustering of words related to the target word. Three main methods have been proposed in the literature:[1][2]\\nThe underlying hypothesis of this approach is that, words are semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, with in similar context windows, or in similar syntactic contexts.[3] Each occurrence of a target word in a corpus is represented as a context vector. These context vectors can be either first-order vectors, which directly represent the context at hand, or second-order vectors, i.e., the contexts of the target word are similar if their words tend to co-occur together. The vectors are then clustered into groups, each identifying a sense of the target word. A well-known approach to context clustering is the Context-group Discrimination algorithm [4] based on large matrix computation methods.\\nWord clustering is a different approach to the induction of word senses. It consists of clustering words, which are semantically similar and can thus bear a specific meaning. Lin’s algorithm [5] is a prototypical example of word clustering, which is based on syntactic dependency statistics, which occur in a corpus to produce sets of words for each discovered sense of a target word.[6] The Clustering By Committee (CBC) [7] also uses syntactic contexts, but exploits a similarity matrix to encode the similarities between words and relies on the notion of committees to output different senses of the word of interest. These approaches are hard to obtain on a large scale for many domain and languages.\\nThe main hypothesis of co-occurrence graphs assumes that the semantics of a word can be represented by means of a co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. These approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical [8] or collocational relations.[9] HyperLex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters.[10] To deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely Curvature Clustering, Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++), and Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree Clustering (B-MST).[11] The patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. A randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices[12] is Chinese Whispers. By applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks.\\n\\nLaguna\\'s 1st congressional district is one of the six congressional districts of the Philippines in the province of Laguna, formerly La Laguna.

The company was founded in 1942 in Treviglio (Bergamo), Italy, by the brothers Francesco and Eugenio Cassani. SAME main products are tractors and front loaders. The company is now part of the SDF Group.[1]\\nIn 1927, the brothers Francesco and Eugenio Cassani designed and built the Cassani 40CV agricultural tractor. This was powered by a Diesel engine, a form of propulsion that had begun to be used in industrial, military and rail vehicle applications since the 1920s. The engine was a two stroke horizontal two-cylinder unit with a capacity of 12,723 cm3 producing forty horsepower at 550 rpm, with wick ignition, a compressed air starter system with pressurised air tank air, 4 speeds (3 FWD and 1 REV) and a top speed of 15\\xa0km/h.[2] This tractor was sold at a price of 28,000 Lire. The tractor designed by Cassani was sold under license by Officine Gaetano Barbieri in Castelmaggiore.\\nEstablished in 1942, the newly formed company SAME initially manufactured petrol and diesel engines for civil and industrial applications such as winches, cranes, ploughs and fire-fighting pumps. In 1946, SAME introduced its first motor mower models, powered by an 8 HP petrol engine.\\nAt the Milan Trade Fair in 1946, SAME presented its first 3-wheeled petrol-powered motor mower, which could also be attached to other agricultural machinery and implements. This was the company\\'s first “universal tractor”, catering for the needs of the market in the years immediately following the Second World War.\\nThe SAME 3R/10, a universal small tractor powered by a single cylinder 10 HP petrol engine, was presented in 1948. This machine had two driving wheels and a single steering wheel, variable track and reversible drive. The tractor was awarded the gold medal by the Turin Agricultural Academy. On 24 October 1948, the “Giornale dell’Agricoltura” described it as “a gem of Italian industry”.[3]\\nProduction of the brand\\'s petrol powered models began in 1950, with the introduction of the 10 HP SAME 4R/10 and the 20 HP 4R/20.\\n1952 saw the launch of the DA 25, the first mass-produced modern tractor with all-wheel drive, powered by a 25 HP, 2280 cm3 two cylinder diesel engine, with a 7 speed transmission and a top speed of 24.3\\xa0km/h. The name DA stood for Diesel Aria (Diesel Air), as the engine was air-cooled, in keeping with SAME traditions. Mass production of four-wheel drive tractors, with original dual traction system, already conceived in 1928, begins.\\nThe new DA 30 DT was launched in 1957. Offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the DA 25. During this period, SAME also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and reversible ploughs), spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper trailers, irrigation pumps and auger drills. The first DA 30 DT models were painted orange with green wheels, while towards the end of the 1950s. The colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine.\\nThe SAME 240 was launched in 1958. This was known as the \\'intelligent tractor\\', as it was equipped as standard with the innovative S.A.C. (\\'Stazione Automatica di Controllo\\' - \\'Automatic Control Station\\') lower hitch arm draft control system conceived by SAME, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years. This tractor was powered by a 42 HP two cylinder unit, with 6 forward speeds, one reverse speed and a top speed of 28.9\\xa0km/h.\\n1961 was the year of the SAME Puledro and the Samecar, a tractor which, after working the land, could then also be used to transport produce in its load bay. A new range of 6 and 8 cylinder engines was also developed during this period.\\nAt the Verona expo in 1965, SAME presented its new V engines and the Italia V, Atlanta, Sametto V and 450 V tractors. Another major development was the change from traditional rounded cowls to a more modern, boxy design.\\nThe Centauro range, consisting of three different models, was launched in 1965. These tractors were powered by a 3500 cm3 V4 engine producing 55 HP, with 8 forward speeds, 4 reverse speeds and a top speed of 34.8\\xa0km/h.\\nThe 1972 Corsaro 70 and Saturno 80 tractors were presented in 1972. In 1973, SAME bought Lamborghini Trattori S.p.A. from Ferruccio Lamborghini, in its own range. In 1979, SAME acquired the Swiss Hürlimann Traktoren brand and changed its name to Gruppo SLH (SAME+Lamborghini+Hürlimann), becoming the second largest tractor producer in Italy and a leading manufacturer on a global scale.\\nThe SAME Explorer family, which was to become one of the most successful product ranges in the history of the company, was launched in 1983. This was the first Italian-built tractor with a top speed of 40\\xa0km/h, and the only tractor with 4-wheel braking.\\nThe technology offered by Gruppo SLH at the end of the 1980s also included the original Twin Vision video camera rear view system. SAME engine technology also took a major step forward, with electronically controlled fuel injection available for the entire 1000 Series.\\nIn 1991, the Electronic PowerShift transmission, designed specifically for high power applications, was launched together with the Titan range, while the Frutteto II introduced a family of tractors dedicated for use in fruit orchards and vineyards.\\nIn 1995, Gruppo SLH acquired the agricultural machinery division of Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz, giving rise to the SAME Deutz-Fahr group.\\nIn 1999, SAME introduced the Galileo self-levelling system in the Rubin 200 tractor range. This system, developed to facilitate working on gradients, won the Golden Tractor for design Millennium Edition award in 2000.\\n2007 marked the 80th anniversary of the first tractor built by Francesco and Eugenio - the Cassani 40CV.\\nOn 12 October 2012, SAME celebrated its 70th birthday at its historical headquarters in Treviglio. To mark the occasion, the Italian brand announced a spate of new investments and new models for the future, chief among which the \"Virtus\" (100-110-120-130 HP) tractor family, designed by Italdesign Giugiaro.\\nCassani:\\nSAME:\\nSAME tractors:\\nNumerous 1:32 and 1:43 scale models of SAME tractors are produced by renowned model manufacturers such as Ros-Agritec in Italy, Siku in Germany, Universal Hobbies in France and Britains in the United Kingdom.\\nCassani:\\nSAME:\\nQionglong Mountain (Chinese: 穹窿山; pinyin: QióngLóng shān) is the highest mountain of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.

It was written and narrated by Damon Fox.\\nSince its release, Traces of Death has been followed by four sequels. The first sequel, Traces of Death II, was released in June 1994. This was followed by Traces of Death III in December 1994, Traces of Death IV: Resurrected in 1996 and Traces of Death V: Back in Action in April 2000.\\nIn the first two films of the series, Damon Fox was the narrator. Darrin Ramage, who would later become the founder of Brain Damage Films, would become the host for the third, fourth and fifth volumes. Unlike Faces of Death, the footage throughout the entire films are real and are not staged or reenacted. Starting with Traces of Death II, scenes were accompanied by background music from death metal and grindcore bands.\\nAlso contained in the series, especially in the first one, is footage of step-by-step autopsy procedures, which are shown from a coroner\\'s point of view. Most of the other footage is recognizably notable. Among the footage samples seen on Traces of Death and in the sequels that followed are listed below.\\nThe first film of the series also contains allegedly staged footage from Savage Man Savage Beast, where a tourist, Pit Dernitz supposedly gets mauled and eaten by African lions.\\nOther scenes that feature animals include undated footage of a pig experiment by military scientists at the Burn Center in Fort Sam Houston (derived from a 1987 mondo film entitled True Gore), an animal control officer, Florence Crowell being attacked by a pit bull in Los Angeles, California in 1987, and a black bear getting shocked off a utility pole in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1989.\\nThe first two films both contain scenes of sex reassignment surgery, which is featured in the 1974 mondo film Shocking Asia. Some autopsy footages were taken from the 1961 U.S. Army training film Basic Autopsy Procedure.\\nAlso included is an interview with James Vance, who had attempted suicide with a shotgun at a church playground in Sparks, Nevada (taken from the documentary Dream Deceivers).\\nThe only known footage showing evidence of Ilse Koch is included as well.\\nThere is one unusual piece of footage taken at a monster truck show in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 23, 1992. What makes this footage so unusual is that the robot transformer at the show malfunctioned. A large rod from the malfunctioning robot went into the actor of the alien suit\\'s chest, and exploded.\\nAnother notable air show crash in the film took place in Plainview, Texas, on September 11, 1983, where the pilot lost both his plane\\'s wings in mid-air and plummeted into the field below. There are many other various plane crashes and race car crashes during the middle and towards the end of the film.\\nThe third edition starts with crime scenes in urban American cities such as New York City, ranging from murders to traffic crashes. These pieces look as if taken from the \\'60s and \\'70s.\\nThis volume also shows what it is like to survive an attack, as in a 1991 press conference of Frank Tempest, an English man disfigured in the face when he was attacked by two pit bulls.\\nAlso included is graphic content of gang violence in Russia, various motocross and amateur race car crashes, and cockfighting held in the Philippines.\\nAnother piece of notable footage in the fourth volume is a moose killing a man in Anchorage, Alaska on January 9, 1995.\\nTowards the start of the film graphic photographs of birth defects are shown.\\nThere is also footage of traffic crashes from the graphic driving education film, Signal 30.\\nThe last volume starts with three police chases. The first was in Los Angeles in June 1996. The second was also in Los Angeles, but it took place in June 1995. The third took place in Whittier, California in September 1995. All were televised live by helicopter pilot Zoey Tur.\\nThe music clearance were provided by Subtempeco Muzik (pseudonymously credited as T.O.D.), which derived from various film soundtracks.[1] Later in Traces of Death 3, the first soundtrack album was released on CD.The soundtrack for the first installment were tracks by J.R.

In 1997, Amy Hochberg, a woman living in Coaldale, Pennsylvania rented the film from a video store and was so disgusted by the film\\'s content that she considered keeping the tape as to avoid children from procuring it from the store. She also contacted multiple animal rights groups after witnessing a scene in the film wherein a pig is experimented on with a blowtorch. She also lodged a complaint with the video store she had rented it from, as she thought the film was simply \"911 calls with a little more\".[4]\\nIn 2003, a DVD boxset of the film and its sequels were confiscated by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, after being deemed to \"contravene Regulation 4A(1A)(a) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.\"[5]\\nIn 2005, the British Board of Film Classification refused to give the first film an age certificate, effectively banning it. The BBFC considered the film to have \"no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the images shown\", while also suggesting that the film could potentially breach UK law under the Obscene Publications Act.[6]\\nThe hybrid elm cultivar Ulmus × hollandica \\'Fastigiata\\' was first listed and described as Ulmus glabra fastigiata, a narrow-crowned elm with large smooth leaves, by Petzold and Kirchner in Arboretum Muscaviense (1864).[1] C. Berndt of the Berndt Nursery, Zirlau, Schweidnitz, described an elm of the same name in Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft (1915, including a photograph), that he had received in 1903 \"from a renowned nursery in Holstein\" as Ulmus montana fastigiata macrophylla. A tree of that name had been listed by Dieck in 1885 without description.[2] Berndt reported that his U. glabra fastigiata was \"easy to confuse with U. montana superba\", a tree \"known in the Magdeburg region as Ulmus praestans\", a statement confirming that, like that cultivar, his tree was a form of U. × hollandica.[3] Karl Gustav Hartwig who received specimens of U. praestans from Kiessling of the Magdeburg city nursery in 1908, concluded (1912) that U. glabra fastigiata Kirchner was indistinguishable in leaf or habit from U. praestans.[4] An U. campestris glabra fastigiata Arb. Musc. [ = Kirchner] was distributed by the Hesse Nursery, Weener, Germany, in the 1930s, where it was listed separately from U. praestans.[5]\\nThe Späth nursery of Berlin marketed an U. montana fastigiata glabra in the 1890s and early 1900s.[6] Bean (1925) listed an U. glabra \\'Fastigiata Stricta\\' (1925).[7]\\nNot to be confused with Exeter Elm, Loudon\\'s U. montana fastigiata (1838)[8] and  Elwes and Henry\\'s U. montana var. fastigiata (1913).[9]\\nKirchner\\'s Ulmus glabra fastigiata was narrow-crowned, with large smoothish leaves of firmer texture than his Ulmus glabra Mill.. Berndt\\'s Ulmus glabra fastigiata was a tree of tight narrow pyramidal growth, the leaf being dark, acuminate, irregularly veined, and often wider at the top than lower down. Berndt reported the tree as \"less vigorous than Ulmus montana superba\" [ = U. praestans].[3]\\nUlmus glabra fastigiata was cultivated in Silesia by the Berndt Nursery, Zirlau, Schweidnitz, in the early 20th century. Berndt reported that, though stocked in only a few nurseries, it was praised at the 20th Century Exhibition in Breslau. No specimens are known to survive.\\n\\nThe trio  competition in aerobic gymnastics at the 2001 World Games in Akita was played from 17 to 18 August.

The plants form flat, sprawling discs on solid surfaces in freshwater streams worldwide, usually as epiphytes on aquatic plants or growing on the surface of stones. They are seen as one of two most probable sister groups to land plant species,[2][3][4] the second candidate group being the Characeae. The issue is still not resolved.[4] As they show some of the earliest and simplest features of multicellular plant growth, they are ideal model organisms in the field of synthetic biology.[citation needed] They are easy to culture and techniques that have been used to study Arabidopsis thaliana are now being applied to Coleochaete.[5]\\nColeochaete has a sterile jacket of cells that surround the gametangia and zygotes that are protected by a layer of sterile cells after fertilization.  However, unlike land plants, Coleochaete has zygotic meiosis, meiosis taking place directly in the zygote and not in diploid cells resulting from mitotic division of the zygote.[4]\\n\\nThis green algae-related article is a stub.

              "'michał antoni łempicki (russian: михаил михайлович лэмпицкий) (1856-1930) was a mining engineer and entrepreneur. he was a polish public and political figure, deputy of the state duma of the russian empire for the piotrków governorate. michał łempicki was born on september 14, 1856, near sztum[verification needed], russian empire (in today\\'s poland). his mother was izabela, his father, michał senior (1818-1895), was a nobleman from the province of płock, then in the congress poland. in 1861, he was sentenced to exile to samara. a year later, his wife isabella was allowed to join him with their three children, michał antoni and his sisters. after a brief release to saint petersburg in 1871, the samara exile resumed till 1886. in 1874, the young michał graduated from the samara gymnasium and moved to saint petersburg. from 1874 to 1881, he studied at the st. petersburg mining institute (russian: санкт-петербургский горный институт): he was graduated both from the institute natural sciences department and from the physics-mathematics faculty of saint petersburg imperial university. from 1881 onwards, he served in the mining department as the head of the polish mining factories transferred from warsaw. in 1884, he conducted geological research in the provinces of kharkiv, yekaterinoslav and kursk, with the civil servant rank of titular advisor (russian: титулярный советник). the next year, he became the acting senior clerk of the salt division of the mining department. as such, michał łempicki carried out several works for the russian empire: in 1890, he joined the polish mining plants section of the mining department: to this end, he left saint petersburg to live in the dąbrowa basin on polish territory. in 1895, he became a member of the main mining directorate (russian: главное горное управление - ггу), offering technical expertise to the mining company \"граф ренард\" (\"count renard\") in sosnowica region; there he eventually took over the management of the society till 1901. in 1896, he founded the company m. łempicki i spółka przedsiębiorstwo górnicze, wiertnicze i hydrologiczne (english: m. łempicki\\'s company of mining, drilling and hydrology), based in sosnowiec, silesia: it operated not only in silesia, but also in the territory of the russian partition and in siberia. the company is still active today under the name g-drilling- united oilfield services. during the same period, michał was an active member of various polish industrial and scientific societies: hence in 1891 he entered the \"physiographic commission of the academy of arts and sciences\", which founders originated from the dąbrowa basin. from 1901 to 1906, he was the managing director of the joint stock company of the strahovitsky mining plants in the radom province. in 1906, łempicki had gathered several positions in the mining business: michał łempicki published a number of papers related to mining exploitation. he retired in 1912 with the administrative civilian rank of state councilor. since 1900, he was the co-owner of a mining and drilling firm m. łempicki and co. in the piotrków governorate: it carried out large-scale drilling operations in poland, ukraine, belarus and lithuania, notably to build artesian wells. the company, which name changed over the years, had after 1905 many shareholders, in particular engineers from the dąbrowa basin (józef předpelsky, anthony olszewski, stanislav sventokhovsky, edward poplavsky). local branches were established in katowice, warsaw and vilnius. łempicki had also invested in several other business, including the korwinów ceramic factory near czestochowa or an agricultural machinery factory in lublin. the amount of his assets is estimated at 500 000 imperial rubles. in november 1905, michał took part in the polish delegation appealing to the prime minister sergei witte. the goal of this petition was to ask for a reconsideration of the policy of the russian government towards the kingdom of poland. he was very active among the polish community of saint petersburg, becoming in march 1906, the secretary of the polish central election committee in the russian capital. as a matter of fact, łempicki was harassed by the russian authorities. indeed in 1907, having failed to be elected to the second state duma, michał was forced to emigrate to switzerland then germany. back to poland, he continued to administer his mining companies. on october 20, 1912, he was elected to the fourth convocation of the state duma, as representative of the piotrków governorate. he then joined the \"koło polskie\" (english: polish wheel-russian: польское коло), a group of polish deputies in the state duma of the russian empire. at the duma, he was a member of the budget commission, the trade and industry commission and the labor commission. on the eve of the first world war, łempicki entered the occupied territory of poland with an austrian passport. according to polish sources, he had renounced citizenship, even though he still signed his articles in the western press as \"deputy of the russian state duma\" (french: \"député a la douma d\\'empire\"). with the help of austria-hungary, he co-created a league of polish sovereignty and became its president. his actions were utterly condemned by the russian duma: on december 12, 1915, he was expelled from the \"koło polskie\" for \"anti-russian activity\". following the occupation of the congress poland by german troops, michał actively cooperated with the ruling administration: as a consequence, on december 15, 1916, he was deprived of his deputy mandate by a decree of the state duma, officially for non-attendance at meetings. from 1917 to 1919, łempicki participated to the \"provisional council of state\" where he collaborated, inter alia, with józef piłsudski, franciszek radziwiłł or władysław studnicki: he chaired the department of the interior, which was responsible for matters related to the organization of local administration, health care and electoral law. since 1917, he was also a member of the military commission established by the provisional council of state. at the restoration of poland\\'s independence, he was appointed permanent consultant to the ministry of industry and trade. in particular, he was engaged in the work organization in mines and metallurgical plants in silesia and in the dąbrowa basin. he took part in the preparation of the draft law on mining and on the status of the state geological institute. furthermore, he actively participated in the foundation of polish military formations. in 1921, łempicki and his wife moved to bydgoszcz, where they found here a large group of former inhabitants of the eastern borderlands. he knew the city after previous stays at a friend\\'s flat at 23 chrobrego street. they lived in the newly built villa at 6 chopina street. in bydgoszcz, michał kept contact with warsaw institutions, where he liked to visit the sejm and enter into political discussions with various ministries, having still many friends in this domain. additionally, he often met with colleagues from the society of industrialists and was still a shareholder of many companies. he started to write articles for the daily local journal \"dziennik bydgoski\". in the 1920s, he was politically associated with the national democratic movement. in his villa, he had gathered a rich library, ornamented with many pictures (mainly portraits of children) by his deceased sister leokadia łempicka (1865–1913). he shared his passion of books with a good friend of his, dr. władysław bełza. even before world war i, łempicki started to cooperate with newspapers, like the kurier warszawski. he co-founded in 1903 the \"przegląd górniczo-hutniczy\", a journal related to questions about mining and metallurgical industry. in bydgoszcz, he pursued his writings (mainly political and social-oriented) for the \"dziennik bydgoski\". he died on december 29, 1930, at the age of 74. his funeral took place on january 1, 1931: according to his will, there were neither speeches nor wreathes over the grave. its coffin was placed in the \"missionary fathers church\" in ossoliński avenue. he was buried in the \"nowofarny cemetery\" in bydgoszcz. michał łempicki bequeathed all his collections, about 800 volumes and the correspondence of his father michał, to the city of bydgoszcz. the donation comprised books, paintings, letters that his father once received from friends, autographs of archbishop zygmunt feliński, poet karol baliński, historian tadeusz korzon, mikhail bakunin and writer eliza orzeszkowa. in january 1928, on łempicki\\'s initiative, the \"łempicki family association\" was established. it aimed at providing moral and material support, granting scholarships to young people in education and creating institutions of family and social benefit. łempicki wanted also this institution to establish sheltering houses in mazovia and in white and red ruthenia. during their life, the couple made regular donations to the kuchnia kresowa, an association run by poles from the eastern borderlands and providing food for people in the need. likewise, they supported local orphanage, the polish red cross or the charity actions conducted by the \"dziennik bydgoski\". michał łempicki was one of the contributors to the construction in bydgoszcz of the first monument to henryk sienkiewicz elevated in poland. the original statue from 1927 and funded via a local committee composed led by witold bełza, was razed down in september 1939. the current monument was made by horno-popławski in 1968, is located on the very site of its predecessor, in today\\'s jan kochanowski park. his wife was józefa née biedrzyńska (russian: йозефина урождённая бичинская) from korwin: they got married on july 23, 1889, in kielce. she had an artistic penchant at her death, józefina bequeathed the collections of 48 paintings by leokadia, michał\\'s sister: they are now part of the collections of the regional museum in bydgoszcz. the łempicki family had no children. his father michał senior was sentenced two times by the tsarist regime, as an opposent to the alexander ii of russia influenced by the anarchist theories of mikhail bakunin: michał łempicki had several siblings: while living as a citizen of the russian empire, michał łempicki received two decorations: in january, 2008 the bbc reported that simba makoni might be nominated to run against robert mugabe in the zimbabwean 2008 presidential election. on 5 february 2008 simba makoni held a press conference in harare where he stated that he was challenging robert mugabe to become the next president of zimbabwe. up to that point he had remained a member of the zanu-pf politburo and the party\\'s deputy secretary of economic affairs. he told reporters, flanked by ibbo mandaza and retired major kudzai mbudzi: \"following very extensive and intensive consultations with party members and activists countrywide, and also with others outside the party, i have accepted the call and hereby advise the people of zimbabwe that i offer myself as candidate for the office of president...i share the agony and anguish of all citizens over the extreme hardships that we all have endured for nearly 10 years now...i also share the widely held view that these hardships are a result of failure of national leadership and that change at that level is a pre-requisite for change at other levels of national endeavour.\"makoni said that he would have liked to run as zanu-pf\\'s candidate, but since he could not, he was running as an independent. he later said that his conclusion that political change was necessary was not the result of a \"st.-paul-on-the-road-to-damascus awakening. this has been a continuum, incremental, things have been building up.\" running under the slogan \"let\\'s get zimbabwe working again\", makoni\\'s theme was dawn, and this name was given to the organisation supporting his campaign, mavambo/kusile/dawn. he adopted the yellow as his campaign colour. the colour represents gold and the wealth of zimbabwe, reinforcing his focus on solutions to the current economic crisis. the colour also represents the rising sun and the dawn of a new zimbabwe, anchored in the hopes and aspirations of zimbabweans for a brighter future. his campaign logo appeared very similar to that of united states presidential candidate barack obama\\'s. joseph chinotimba, a notorious war veteran who led the violent invasions of white owned farms in 2000, threatened makoni with violence following the announcement of his candidature. a leading figure in zanu-pf, emmerson mnangagwa, told zbc tv that by choosing to stand for a position when the party had already chosen someone to stand for that position, makoni had expelled himself from the party. the herald newspaper denounced makoni as being a pawn of the united kingdom whose candidacy was being used in hopes of splitting the zanu-pf vote so that morgan tsvangirai of the movement for democratic change (mdc) could win the election. speaking on 7 february, makoni denied claims that he was a western pawn or that he was being used by zanu-pf itself to split the opposition vote. he also said that the zanu-pf constitution did not provide for self-expulsion and that still considered himself a member of zanu-pf until and unless he is expelled from the party through due process. referring to support he claims to have inside zanu-pf, he urged these supporters to \"remain steadfast and not be intimidated\". zanu-pf spokesman nathan shamuyarira subsequently sought to clarify the matter by saying that makoni was expelled from the party, in accordance with party rules providing for the expulsion of a member who challenges a designated zanu-pf candidate in an election, and he said that anyone who supported makoni would be expelled as well. morgan tsvangirai said on 11 february that makoni was merely \"old wine in a new bottle\" and that he would not ally with makoni for the election. mugabe spoke about makoni\\'s candidacy for the first time on 21 february, describing it as \"absolutely disgraceful\", comparing makoni to a prostitute, and criticizing makoni for what he considered a self-important attitude. on 15 february, arthur mutambara, the leader of another mdc faction not led by tsvangirai, said that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back makoni. at the opening of makoni\\'s campaign on 29 february, former interior minister dumiso dabengwa and former speaker of parliament cyril ndebele were present to support him. also present at white city hall where makoni launched his campaign was edgar tekere who vowed to de-campaign mugabe until election time. simba makoni received 8.3% of the vote in the first round. war is an intense armed conflict[a] between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. it is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. while some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances. the english word war derives from the 11th-century old english words wyrre and werre, from old french werre (also guerre as in modern french), in turn from the frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the proto-germanic *werzō \\'mixture, confusion\\'. the word is related to the old saxon werran, old high german werran, and the german verwirren, meaning \"to confuse\", \"to perplex\", and \"to bring into confusion\". the earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a mesolithic cemetery in jebel sahaba, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. about forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death. since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe. the advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. according to conway w. henderson, \"one source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 bc and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (beer 1981: 20).\" an unfavorable review of this estimate mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: \"in addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed \\'approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war\\' to \\'approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&c.\\'\" the lower figure is more plausible, but could still be on the high side considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 bc and 2002 ad (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total. primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1% of deaths and claimed 400 million victims. added to the aforementioned figure of 1,240 million between 3500 bc and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. for comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century. in war before civilization, lawrence h. keeley, a professor at the university of illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly. keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. all of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids. william rubinstein wrote \"pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...\\'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the europeans].\\'\" in western europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place. during the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the political left as a force to be reckoned with. in 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, albert einstein famously stated, \"i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought, but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones.\" mao zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the united states since, even if \"half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.\" a distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies. the major exceptions were the korean war, the indo-pakistani war of 1971, the iran–iraq war, the gulf war, the eritrean–ethiopian war, and the russo-ukrainian war. the human security report 2005 documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the cold war in the early 1990s. however, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the center for international development and conflict management\\'s \"peace and conflict\" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled. entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. war aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve. fried defines war aims as \"the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war\". tangible/intangible aims: explicit/implicit aims: positive/negative aims: war aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into \"peace conditions\" – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war. throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. however, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. while conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. for instance, the thirty years\\' war (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as world war i, although it was higher during world war ii (wwii). that said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since wwii has been unusually peaceful. the deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is world war ii, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the mongol conquests at up to 60 million. as concerns a belligerent\\'s losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the paraguayan war (see paraguayan war casualties). in 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. in 2003, richard smalley identified war as the sixth biggest problem (of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years. war usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. for instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the byelorussian ssr in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers. three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. these are the two world wars, followed by the second sino-japanese war (which is sometimes considered part of world war ii, or as overlapping). most of the others involved china or neighboring peoples. the death toll of world war ii, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls. military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, and death. in every war in which american soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.swank and marchand\\'s world war ii study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders. one-tenth of mobilised american men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white american males aged 13 to 43 died in the american civil war, including about 6% in the north and approximately 18% in the south. the war remains the deadliest conflict in american history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. united states military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. of the 60 million european military personnel who were mobilized in world war i, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. during napoleon\\'s retreat from moscow, more french military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the russians. of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the neman on 25 june 1812, less than 40,000 returned. more military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. in addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. for instance, during the seven years\\' war, the royal navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were \\'missing\\'. it is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war. most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine, disease, and death in the civilian population). during the thirty years\\' war in europe, the population of the holy roman empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. war also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. a medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking water. most estimates of world war ii casualties indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of whom were civilians. deaths in the soviet union were around 27 million. since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar soviet union was much lower than it otherwise would have been. once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. in certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. for example, the territory of alsace-lorraine has been traded between france and germany on three different occasions. typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. some economists[who?] believe war can stimulate a country\\'s economy (high government spending for world war ii is often credited with bringing the u.s. out of the great depression by most keynesian economists), but in many cases, such as the wars of louis xiv, the franco-prussian war, and world war i, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. for example, russia\\'s involvement in world war i took such a toll on the russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the russian revolution of 1917. world war ii was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion u.s. dollars on the war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices). the great depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials. by the end of the war, 70% of european industrial infrastructure was destroyed. property damage in the soviet union inflicted by the axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. the combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries. there are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common. carl von clausewitz said, \\'every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.\\' dutch psychoanalyst joost meerloo held that, \"war is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.\" other psychoanalysts such as e.f.m. durban and john bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent. this aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies. by this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. the italian psychoanalyst franco fornari, a follower of melanie klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective \"elaboration\" of mourning. fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \"love need\": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. for the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation. despite fornari\\'s theory that man\\'s altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. one psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by maurice walsh. he argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. war is caused by leaders who seek war such as napoleon and hitler. such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war. naturally, the common people don\\'t want war; neither in russia nor in england nor in america, nor for that matter in germany. that is understood. but, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. that is easy. all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. it works the same way in any country.several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. there are two main schools: one sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition. the latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states. psychologist and linguist steven pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. [failed verification] he also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group\\'s (or an individual\\'s) reputation (\"honor\").[citation needed] crofoot and wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which \"coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups\", is a characteristic of most human societies. those in which it has been lacking \"tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors\". ashley montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. montagu\\'s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the chewong and semai of the malay peninsula. bobbi s. low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive. war can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. in this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. war has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity. while this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. there are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including presidents of the united states and u.s. generals, expressed support for an economic view of war. the marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism. marxist economists karl kautsky, rosa luxemburg, rudolf hilferding and vladimir lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand. since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism. demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, malthusian and youth bulge theories: malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict. pope urban ii in 1095, on the eve of the first crusade, advocating crusade as a solution to european overpopulation, said: for this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. enter upon the road to the holy sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. this is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. thomas malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine. the violent herder–farmer conflicts in nigeria, mali, sudan and other countries in the sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth. according to heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the \"fighting age\" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. it will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay. heinsohn saw both past \"christianist\" european colonialism and imperialism, as well as today\\'s islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern europe, including the french revolution of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest german youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of nazism in germany in the 1930s. the 1994 rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge. youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the world bank, population action international, and the berlin institute for population and development. youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination. geoffrey parker argues that what distinguishes the \"western way of war\" based in western europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: the western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and—from about 1500 onward—a unique system of war finance. the combination of all five provided a formula for military success....the outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline. parker argues that western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, \"the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they\\'re attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.\" discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small \"artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency. rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. rationalism (and neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. in \"rationalist explanations for war\", james fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war: \"issue indivisibility\" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other. \"information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent\" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state\\'s victory or loss. for instance, geoffrey blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. he cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, \"war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.\" thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states\\' inability to make credible commitments. within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias, but are still \"as rational as you and me\". according to philosopher iain king, \"most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....\" king asserts that \"most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink\" which is faulty, but still rational. the rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. the iraq war proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars. the statistical analysis of war was pioneered by lewis fry richardson following world war i. more recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the correlates of war project, peter brecke and the uppsala conflict data program.[citation needed] the following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. this kind of division was first proposed by kenneth waltz in man, the state, and war and has been often used by political scientists since then. : 143 there are several different international relations theory schools. supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma. : 145 within the realist school as represented by scholars such as henry kissinger and hans morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as kenneth waltz and john mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are: the two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance. : 148 liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. realists[who?] respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. : 149 furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. : 150 empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don\\'t necessarily trade less with each other. : 150 these theories suggest differences in people\\'s personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. : 157 for instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases, : 157 such as prospect theory. the morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years. the two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello. jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. there are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used. jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. the two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. the principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent. the just war theory was foundational in the creation of the united nations and in international law\\'s regulations on legitimate war. fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as pragmatism, racism, and social darwinism, hold that violence is good. pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. social darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. these are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the means. lewis coser, u.s. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society. religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the second vatican council document gaudiem et spes: \"any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against god and man himself. it merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.\" anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, world war i, world war ii, and the vietnam war. in the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the united states invasion of afghanistan and iraq. protests opposing the war in afghanistan occurred in europe, asia, and the united states. during a war, brief pauses of violence may be called for, and further agreed to— ceasefire, temporary cessation, humanitarian pauses and corridors, days of tranquility, de-confliction arrangements. there a number of disadvantages, obstacles and hesitations against implementing such pauses such as a humanitarian corridor. pauses in conflict are also ill-advised; reasons such as \"delay of defeat\" and the \"weakening of credibility\". natural causes for a pause may include events such as the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. brian fleming (born october 8, 1971) is an american professional wrestler. he is best known by his ring name al katrazz, a word play on the name of alcatraz prison and a reference fleming\\'s gimmick of a convict. after

match at entertainment overload. after several title defenses, hardkore, inc. lost the title back to the ballard brothers at overload on february 20, 2004 in a tables, ladders, and chairs match. katrazz left upw in 2006 in order to participate in the tapings for wrestling society x, and he wrestled his last match for upw on january 1, 2007, which he lost to human tornado at the o.c. dojo event. katrazz, debuted in the alternative wrestling show on may 31, 2003 in a six-man tag team match, where he reunited with hardkore kidd and teamed with adam pearce to defeat babi slymm, disco machine, and super dragon. over the following months, katrazz was victorious over the likes of slymm, dragon, kenny king, disco machine, and excalibur. on may 1, 2004, he and hardkore kidd reformed hardkore inc. and won the tag team championship by defeating lil cholo and scorpio sky. after kidd left the asw, katrazz selected adam pearce as his new tag team partner and they successfully retained the title against joey ryan and scott lost on may 29. katrazz then picked skulu as his second replacement partner, and together they retained the title two months later against black metal and king jakal. at a major styles clash on september 25, katrazz and skulu lost the title to misterioso and super boy. in 2005, katrazz attempted to reclaim the tag team title with davey richards, first unsuccessfully challenging los chivos (enigma de oro and kayam) on june 18. they were again unsuccessful after los chivo retained their title in a four-way tag team match on july 30 that also involved the teams of junior and phoenix star and ronin and top gun talwar. after losing to the heavyweight champion human tornado at turkey sandwich on november 26 via disqualification, he captured the championship on may 20, 2006 at mayhem: a fight for the belt. he won a 32-man bunkhouse brawl at bart\\'s bunkhouse brawl on july 29 to retain the heavyweight title after lasting an hour and four minutes. after losing to human tornado via disqualification on september 30 at prelude to a slaughterhouse, the heavyweight title was vacated on october 1. from june 22 an july 27, 2007, katrazz competed in a tournament for the vacant heavyweight championship. after defeating enigma de oro, apollo kahn and peter goodman in the previous rounds, he defeated former tag team partner aaron aguilera at crowning a champion to win his second heavyweight title. on november 4, he lost the championship to lil cholo in a no disqualification falls count anywhere match before leaving the promotion. katrazz joined pro wrestling guerrilla in 2003 and reformed hardkore inc. alongside the hardkore kidd and new allies adam pearce and el jefe. on july 26 at debut show, pwg\\'s inaugural

republic act (r.a.) 6780 enacted in 1990. the hospital caters to the people of region iii, with the people of pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of bataan, nueva ecija, bulacan, tarlac, zambales and aurora as its secondary catchment areas. in the nearly 100 years of existence of the jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital, enormous development had been done in terms of facility improvement, manpower complement and capability enhancement. indeed, the hospital had come a long way. from its beginning in 1921 from the two (2) hectare lot at dolores, san fernando, pampanga donated by the late juan teopaco, it is now regarded as one of the leading referral center in the region. the jblmrh started at an eight (8) bed capacity hospital formerly known as pampanga provincial hospital. it was financed and operated by provincial health funds under the management of six pioneering individuals headed by dr. lorenzo de jesus. to satisfy the growing hospital need of the people, various material improvements were introduced in the hospital, thus increasing its bed capacity from eight (8) beds to fifty (50) beds in january 1951. later in july 1964, the hospital\\'s name changed into central luzon general hospital with the corresponding increase in its bed capacity to one hundred twenty five (125) beds. dr. bartolome vecta was appointed as chief of hospital during this time. further construction of various facilities in the hospital led to the increase in its bed capacity to one hundred fifty (150) in 1972 and again to two hundred beds (200) in 1975. in 1979, dr. vecta was replaced by dr. ignacio valencia. during the incumbency of dr. valencia, a building that can accommodate one hundred beds was constructed, thus finally increasing the hospital\\'s bed capacity into two hundred fifty (250) beds. dr. conrado mariano took the helm of managing the hospital after dr. ignacio valencia. in march 1988, dr. mariano was promoted to assistant regional director at the regional health office no. 3, hence he was replaced by the then provincial health officer of bataan in the person of dr. rogelio reyes. dr. reyes served the hospital for three years until finally in february 1991 he retired to give way to his political ambition. on november 25, 1989, ra no. 6780 entitled “an act of changing the name of the central luzon general hospital located in the municipality of san fernando, province of pampanga, to jose b. lingad memorial general hospital” was one of the bills signed by the then former president corazon c. aquino. it is on this day on that the hospital was recognized as jose b. lingad memorial general hospital. dra. venus galang, the then chief of medical professional staff was appointed as officer-in-charge in march 1991 to fill-in the position left by dr. reyes. during the term of dra. galang, the hospital was being awarded for being a baby friendly hospital. in december 1992, dr. ladislao yuchongco was appointed as permanent chief of hospital of jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital. in his term, he was able to accomplish the accreditation of the anesthesia department. in 1994, dr. ladislao yuchongco was reassigned at the national mental health hospital. from this period until may 1998 the following doctors became officers-in-charge : dr. ricardo t. trinidad - january 1992 to december 1997 dr. emilio cadayona - july 4, to march 21, 1995, dr. manuel ponce - march 22 to january 24, 1996, dra venus galang - february 1, 1996 to march 5, 1996, on january 20, 1997, until march 25, 1997, dr. ladislao yuchongco resumed his post as chief of hospital of jblmrh until he was reassigned to doh-central office. from march 26, 1997, until may 17, 1998, dr. ricardo b. gonzales, dra. cecilia paulino and dra. ethelyn nieto successively became officers-in-charge of the hospital. on may 18, 1998, dr. venancio s. banzon from the provincial health office of bulacan was appointed chief of hospital. dr. banzon is until the present time occupies the said position. the jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital is a level iii tertiary, teaching and training hospital with 250 authorized beds as mandated by r.a. 6780 year 1990. the hospital caters to the people of region iii with the people of pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of bataan, nueva ecija,

seventh year at illinois, harry combes continued to offer the fans of the fighting illini a successful team that they could be follow across the country to record crowds. the 1953-54 team returned one of the most dominate players in the ncaa, johnny \"red\" kerr. during the season, kerr shattered illinois’ single-season scoring record by tallying 556 points in his senior year. kerr’s 1,299 career points in three seasons currently ranks 20th on the all-time illinois scoring list. after his illinois career came to an end, kerr started a 12-year professional career followed by becoming the first head coach of the chicago bulls in 1966. the 1954 team added twin brothers, paul and phil judson from hebron, illinois, bruce brothers and bill ridley as sophomores. a youth movement that helped the illini finish in a 3rd place tie in the big ten. unfortunately the illini would lose 5 total games with three of the five losses coming at the hands of ranked opponents. the starting lineup included

tree of the family myrtaceae native to new south wales and queensland in australia, which can reach 60 metres (200 feet) in height. it generally grows on heavier soils. the cream flowers appear in spring and are fused into compound flowerheads. english botanist james edward smith first described the turpentine as metrosideros glomulifera in 1797, from a collection in the sydney district. it was given its current binomial name by german botanist franz josef niedenzu in 1893. common names include turpentine, luster, red turpentine or red luster. it was formerly known as syncarpia laurifolia ten. two subspecies are recognised, the widespread nominate, and subspecies glabra which is found from bulahdelah north to kempsey and has smooth leaf undersurfaces. in a suitable location, the turpentine grows into a large straight-trunked tree up to 45 or even 55 m (150–180 ft) high with a dbh of up to 1.3 or even 1.5 m (4–5 ft). on poorer soils it grows as a small tree or even adopts a mallee habit. the thick brown bark is fibrous, with deep vertical furrows running down the trunk. the leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and pairs grow close together so that they resemble a whorled group of four leaves. on 0.7–1.3 cm long petioles, the thick leaves are ovate to ellipictal and measure 7–10 cm (3–4 in) long and 2.5–4.5 cm (1–2 in) across with recurved margins. their upper surface is a dull dark green, and lower surface much paler, either covered by fine hairs in subspecies glomulifera or smooth in glabra. flowering takes place from august to december, peaking in september. the cream flowers are fused in groups of seven into compound flowerheads. this is followed by the development of the compound fruit – 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) diameter woody capsules which ripen in summer. the turpentine is found in eastern queensland and new south wales, from atherton in the far north to as far south as murramarang national park. north of gympie, the distribution is fragmented, with colonies on the blackdown and consuelo tablelands, tinaroo district and windsor tableland. the habitat most commonly associated with the turpentine is transitional forest between rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. here it grows as an emergent tree, and is associated with such trees as flooded gum (eucalyptus grandis), tallowwood (e. microcorys), grey ironbark (e. paniculata), white stringybark (e. globoidea), yellow stringybark (e. muelleriana), white-topped box (e. quadrangulata), rough-barked apple (angophora floribunda), brush box (lophostemon confertus) and various rainforest species. it also grows with spotted gum (corymbia maculata) and blackbutt (e. pilularis). on poorer soils, it can grow much smaller in dry sclerophyll forest in association with smooth-barked apple (angophora costata) and yellow bloodwood (corymbia eximia). adaptable to a wide range of soils, the turpentine is most suited to moderate to high-nutrient soils, such as clay soil over wianamatta shale in the sydney region. valleys and flat areas are highly suitable sites. in the sydney region, the species reaches an altitude of 300 m (980 ft), but this extends to 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level in northern queensland. the turpentine is one of the dominant species of the critically endangered sydney turpentine-ironbark forest ecological community. the largest known turpentine, located near the williams river recreation reserve in the barrington tops national park, new south wales, measures 7.90 m (26 ft) trunk circumference at breast height, 58 m (190 ft) tall, 20 m (66 ft) crown spread width and \"points 517\" (points calculated using the national register of big trees formula). the flowers are pollinated by native bees and european honeybees, and possibly flies and moths. the grey-headed flying fox (pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (p. scapulatus) also pollinate the flowers. the rainbow lorikeet (trichoglossus haematodus) and noisy miner (manorina melanocephala) forage for nectar. the turpentine regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber and epicormic buds. turpentine trees are thought to live up to 500 years. highly durable, turpentine timber is used in heavy-traffic flooring, for poles and wharves. it resists marine invertebrates and termites, and is one of the most difficult timbers to ignite. a hardy and adaptable tree, turpentine tolerates heavy soils and frosts, and is suitable for large gardens and parks, where it provides good shade with its dense canopy. benedetti–wehrli stadium is a stadium

girl orphans who were sent from portugal to overseas colonies during the portuguese empire as part of portugal\\'s colonization efforts. the orphans were married to native rulers or portuguese settlers. orfãs do rei translates to \"orphans of the king\", and they were all girls. their fathers were portuguese men who died in battle for the king. they were sent to the colonies of the portuguese empire. the asian colonies contained more portuguese females than was previously thought. bernard sta maria wrote that \"from 1545, king john iii began to send to india (and the far east) with all pomp and distinction many young portuguese women known as \\'orphans of the queen\\' to be married with local young men.\" both noble and non-noble girls were in the órfãs do rei. since these girls were specifically designated as the \"king\\'s\", the portuguese government paid for their care and upbringing before and after they were sent to portuguese india. goa in particular received most of the girls. some were also sent to the colony of brazil. the \"shelter of the castle\" was one of the organizations which arranged for the órfãs do rei to be sent overseas. the age limits were 12–30 years of age. they departed from lisbon and other portuguese cities and arrived in portuguese india, most of them were sent to goa. incentives such as dowries were given with the girls to potential husbands. the dowries consisted of official positions or land. regarding the timespan of the órfãs do rei being sent overseas, it was said that \"the system apparently continued to function intermittently until the (early) eighteenth century.\" in particular, extensive boatloads of girls and their dowries were sent by queen catarina de austria. during the iberian union, the habsburg king of portugal continued the policy of sending female orphans to goa, ignoring protests from the portuguese authorities there. being \"white, catholic, and of good birth\" were the requirements for a girl to become an órfão do rei. the reason that the authorities protested against the king sending the órfãs to india was the lack of husbands. a proponent of the continued shipment of portuguese girls to india was fr. álvaro penteado. one of the aims of shipping the órfãs was to stop portuguese men from marrying women of other races and provide them with portuguese wives. the prevention of mixed-marriage would have resulted in a greater amount of white portuguese. the sex ratio between men and women in goa was skewed, and the shipments of órfãs do rei was an attempt to correct this. frederick charles danvers wrote in 1894 that \"it had for some time been customary to send out orphan girls to india, from orphanages at lisbon, with the view of getting them husbands and so providing for them, and, at the same time, with the view of furnishing wives of their own nation to the portuguese in india, to prevent them from marrying native indian women. in many instances these orphans were also provided with dowries by the state, which occasionally took the form of appointments in the government service, which, though given to the girls themselves, were of course intended to be filled by their husbands. appointments were similarly given to the daughters of indian officials on their marriage, in consideration of the good services rendered to the state by their respective parents; in one case this dowry took the form of the appointment of governor of cranganor.\" afonso de albuquerque also brought in portuguese orphan girls to portuguese malacca in order to colonize the area. one tale related how some dutch privateers seized a ship with portuguese orphan girls and took them as brides. james talboys wheeler wrote in 1881 that \"it was the custom of the king of portugal to send a number of well-born orphan girls every year to goa, with sufficient dowries to procure them husbands in portuguese india. donna lucia was one of three portuguese orphan girls of good family who had been sent to india the previous year. the fleet which carried them was attacked by the dutch, who captured some of the ships, and carried off the three damsels to surat. being passably handsome, most eminent merchants in surat were anxious to marry them. all three became protestants, and were provided with protestant husbands. two had gone off with their husbands to java or elsewhere, but donna lucia had married the wealthiest dutchman at surat and remained there. delia valle found, however, to his great joy, that donna lucia was only a protestant in name. she had been obliged to conform publicly to the protestant \"heresy,\" but was a catholic in private, with the knowledge and connivance of her protestant husband\". bahia in brazil received some of the orphans in 1551. françois pyrard of laval in his account of his voyages, observed some portuguese merchants, when their ship was in danger, \"it was a very miracle that saved us, for the wind was from the sea, and we were so close ashore that we had great difficulty in doubling the point and getting out. i believe more than 1,500 crowns\\' worth of vows were made, which were afterwards duly paid. the principal merchant made one of 800 cruzados: to wit, 400 for an orphan girl to marry withal, and 400 for a lamp and other utensils for a shrine of our lady that is hard by. as soon as he set foot on land he sought out an orphan girl, and fulfilled his promise to her, as also to the churchwardens of the said church. many others, too, did the like; nor did any fail therein, according to his means and the extent of his vows. it is a custom of the portuguese, when they are in peril, to make these vows; but the worst of it is that it makes them indolent and careless about working stoutly to save their lives.\" 1,000 xerafins were added to the dowry by conde de redondo in order to attract suitors for the orphans. female orphans born in india did not have the same privileges as the órfãs do rei. some órfãs do rei married native rulers who were either in exile or allied to the portuguese. the exiled former ruler (liwali) of pemba converted to christianity from islam and was married to an órfã do rei named dona anna de sepulveda in 1607. he also changed his name to felipe da gama, dom filipe, or philip. however, he later reverted to islam. a son, estevão was born of their marriage. he was exiled from pemba to mombasa in 1596. in the 1500s the exiled ruler of the maldives, hassan converted to christianity and also married a portuguese orphan. her name was d. francisca de vasconcelos. the portuguese girls also in goa married native high caste christians. one of the portuguese orphans kidnapped by the dutch privateer ended up in akbar the great\\'s harem. dating back to the mid-1960s, with intercollegiate competition beginning in 1977, bowling at morehead state university is a club sport and is affiliated with the collegiate division of the united states bowling congress. the larry wilson university lanes, built in 1967, are housed in the laughlin health building on the campus of morehead state university. the six-lane center, open to the campus community, serves as the practice facility for the msu bowling teams. during the 2006-2007 academic year, the center was completely remodeled. the lanes are now equipped with brunswick a-2 pin spotters and were resurfaced with the state-of-the-art kegel edge synthetic lane surface. the larry wilson university lanes are one of two bowling facilities in the united states to use this surface. the settee and counter areas were refurbished with new flooring, lighting, and furniture. new masking units were added as well. the lanes are maintained using the kegel phoenix-s. this machine is capable of having oil patterns uploaded, allowing the teams to prepare on patterns more similar to tournament conditions. adjacent to the larry wilson university lanes is a team room to be used for storage of equipment by bowling team members as well as pro shop equipment. in 2009 the facility acquired a fully functional pro-shop to aid the msu bowling team in getting all of their equipment drilled without having to travel to any surrounding bowling center. the center is also usbc sanctioned. also over the summer, the old pins were replaced with the new synthetic twister pins. the msu women have won national championships in 1989, 1998, 2000 and 2002, were runners-up in 1993, and finished in third place in 2006 and 2008. since 2002, the morehead state women\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 six times, from the 2002-2003 season up to the 2007-2008 season. since 2002, the morehead state men\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 in 2002–2003 and 2004–2005 seasons. the men\\'s squad was runner-up in its 2003 tournament and took third place in 2005. the morehead state men\\'s team also made a trip to nationals in 2016 in wichita, kansas. current and former eagle bowlers represent the best that the sport has to offer. four msu bowlers have represented the united states of america in international competition as members of team usa: joy esterson (2004), liz johnson (1994–96, 2008–present), kelly kulick (1998–2001, 2008–present), and david o\\'sullivan (2007). members of junior team usa have also included three eagles: lindsey coulles (2003–04), joy esterson (2003), and david o\\'sullivan (2004). former lady eagle robin (crawford) orlikowski represents her native country as a member of team canada (2000–present). 4. \"bowlers deserve support.\" the trail blazer

bal-sagoth, keyboardist with the band kull, former bassist with the unsigned uk thrash band igniter, and frequent collaborator with the band my dying bride. maudling\\'s primary instruments are roland synthesizers when playing live. he comes from a musical family and was classically trained on piano from an early age. he has contributed to three my dying bride studio albums, provided session orchestration on material by sermon of hypocrisy, and played guest keyboards on a full-length release by the ukrainian metal band semargl. he composed music for the video game adellion. currently maudling is a producer and engineer, operating his own recording studio called waylands forge studios in yorkshire, england. although he composes music mostly in the symphonic metal/black metal genres, maudling\\'s main influences include mostly non-metal bands such as the police, tangerine dream, queen, pat metheny, as well as classical composers such as wagner, stravinsky, tchaikovsky, messiaen and holst.[citation needed] maudling was born in kent and grew up in sheffield, yorkshire. in kent, maudling\\'s parents lived opposite a music store. the store owner, terry bradford, who ended up representing britain on the tv show a song for europe in the 1970s, was a friend of maudling\\'s father and received free records, most of which were classical, contemporary music and jazz.[citation needed]jonny grew up listening to these records, educating himself in a wide variety of musical styles. he had private piano instruction, working through the royal academy of music grade system under elizabeth hydes.[citation needed] at school in south yorkshire, he learnt to play guitar and bass guitar. he played in various bands in his teen years, performing gigs in pubs and nightclubs around the area. he started song writing at this time. he bought his first synthesizer in the mid 1980s with the money he earned working on saturdays. after completing school, maudling tried out for music college, but was considered a borderline candidate with substandard sight-reading ability. he opted instead to concentrate on band work.[citation needed] in the late 1980s and early 1990s maudling played bass, sang and composed songs for a thrash metal outfit called igniter. this band recorded two demos and performed gigs around england, the most high profile of which was a support slot with prominent thrash metal outfit xentrix through alistair maclatchy, a former bandmate in systematic insanity with prominent extreme metal drummer nicholas barker, maudling was introduced to vocalist/lyricist byron roberts in 1993. for several years, roberts had been looking for talented musicians with whom to launch his symphonic black metal band bal-sagoth, but had been unable to meet anyone willing to commit to the project. as a result of maclatchy\\'s introductions, jonny, his brother chris and byron began working together in a band environment. this new outfit went loosely under the provisional name of \"dusk\" for several months, as maclatchy did not like the name bal-sagoth, nor the symphonic black metal direction which roberts had suggested. because of creative and musical differences in direction and style, the band soon parted ways with maclatchy. with the introduction of keyboards, the band found their focus. roberts had the creative team he had long sought to execute his conceptual vision. for maudling, this represented an opportunity for creative musical freedom. roberts, an english post-grad with an interest in 20th century pulp sci-fi writers, could finally implement the ideas he had had for years. the formal inception of bal-sagoth occurred during the summer of 1993. on the strength of their demo which they recorded during december 1993, the band were signed by cacophonous records, a then small subsidiary of vinyl solution based in london. later, they would sign to nuclear blast for three albums, recording a total of six albums to date. maudling composes the music for bal-sagoth, sometimes incorporating ideas from his brother, guitarist chris. he played drums on the first three albums and during subsequent tours, using a session keyboard player, but in 1999 maudling opted to concentrate full-time on keyboards, handing drum duties off to dave mackintosh (dragonforce). maudling also played keyboards on the my dying bride albums the light at the end of the world and the dreadful hours, and composed and recorded all the music for the my dying bride release evinta, based on the existing compositions as originally written by andrew craighan, hamish glencross, et al. he has also contributed keyboard session work to bands including semargl and sermon of hypocrisy. in february 2013, maudling helmed kull, a new project in the symphonic metal sphere. in october 2017 it was announced that maudling had provided orchestration for the new elvenking album secrets of the magick grimoire.[citation

universe, created by roy thomas, dann thomas, and todd mcfarlane, in infinity, inc. #16 (july 1985). a former low-level supervillain, he reformed and joined the infinity inc. team, then later the (fictional) department of extranormal operations (a government agency which regulates superhero activity) as a bureaucrat, eventually rising to the rank of regional director for the eastern seaboard. thus, he now wears a suit and tie instead of a costume, and is also known as director bones. a chain-smoker, he had a habit of speaking in rhyme in early appearances, but he no longer does so. keith david provides the voice of mister bones in stargirl. dr. benjamin (also known as amos) love, a gynecologist, injected six pregnant women with an experimental mutagenic drug. each of the women gave birth to a metahuman child. dr. love kidnapped the infants and raised them himself, never allowing them to leave the house. the children learned all they knew from books, radio, and television. later, the six young adults learned the true story of their origin from reading love\\'s diary and confronted him. they decided to execute him for what he did to them and bones took dr. love out in the desert alone to kill him with his cyanide touch; the doctor begged for his life and bones felt pity for him and let him go. bones later showed the rest of his \"family\" the grave of dr. love. after the supposed death of dr. love, taking their cue from the superheroes they had watched on television, the six created costumes to go with the names doctor love had given them and called their group helix. the team kidnapped the infinitor fury in an attempt to extort money. although they were defeated by fury\\'s teammates, infinity, inc., helix managed to escape. later, the second wildcat (yolanda montez) learned that she was in fact a cousin of helix\\'s new member, carcharo, and that they are both products of the same genetic experiments as helix. the two teams battled to a stalemate and mr. bones was arrested while the others escaped. later, mr. bones was freed from prison by dr. love. carcharo soon turned on the helix and kidnapped mr. bones. in the ensuing struggle carcharo is stabbed with a long piece of metal and in a last-ditch effort bit bones\\' leg off, and then died from cyanide poisoning (see powers and abilities). to make sure bones got medical care, helix turned themselves in to the authorities. mr. bones received an artificial leg and dr. beth chapel (doctor midnight) helped him recover from his injuries, and the two formed a friendly relationship. since they were minors, an informal court hearing was held to determine the fate of the members of helix. it was found that mr. bones had too much of a negative influence on them. infinity, inc. was given custody of bones while the rest of the helix would receive treatment. for most of his time with infinity, inc. mr. bones was not a member of the team even though he took an active part in their adventures and became a hero in his own right, and was eventually accepted by most of the infinitors. during the wedding of hector and lyta hall, harlequin (marcie cooper) used deception to have bones and skyman meet at solomon grundy\\'s room. she then deceived solomon grundy into grabbing bones\\' arm and using him to kill skyman with his cyanide touch. wracked with guilt, bones left infinity, inc. when dr. love gained control of helix and ordered them to kill bones, helix instead turned on love, killing him. helix then left in disgust, telling bones he was no longer one of them. the infinitors, though, granted bones full membership in the team, but bones\\' role in skyman\\'s death would end up being instrumental in their disbanding soon afterward. at some point after infinity, inc. disbanded, mr. bones became director of a local branch of the u.s. department of extranormal operations (d.e.o.), and as a d.e.o., director bones has had numerous interactions with the operations of the superhuman community. he has at times asked various dcu teams for their covert assistance. notably, he has worked with the justice society of america a few times, to the point that mister terrific infiltrated the d.e.o. headquarters to tell mr. bones to stop harassing them. bones was also wary of atom smasher, his old fellow infinitor, after his murder of extant. mr. bones became a supporting character in manhunter. mr. bones and the operations of the d.e.o. are featured in the dc files secret files and origins year 2000 special. in a final crisis tie-in, mr. bones is seen as one of the fallen during a strike against wonder woman\\'s female furies in blüdhaven, with count vertigo and negative woman. he later survived the encounter as he is seen with atom smasher in a bar in justice society of america (vol. 2) #27 discussing the aforementioned incident and the latter\\'s position on the team. when rothstein leaves with other society members, bones is seen on the telephone calling the global peace agency. in 2011, \"the new 52\" rebooted the dc universe. mr. bones is shown to be acting as the d.e.o.\\'s director and tasks agent cameron chase with capturing batwoman. bones now believes himself to be col. jacob kane\\'s illegitimate son. [a] he captures beth kane, sister of batwoman, and blackmails batwoman into agreeing to uncover batman\\'s secret identity. batwoman, col. kane\\'s \"murder of crows\" elite paramilitary group, and the heroine hawkfire fail to rescue beth. agent asaf, compromised by hawkfire, shoots bones in the head after he threatens to kill beth rather than hand her over. [b] asaf later says bones was mentally unbalanced, and is not jacob kane\\'s son. in the pages of \"infinite frontier\", mister bones is talking to cameron chase about the recent events that have transpired since the events of \"dark nights: death metal\" that revealed the multiverse to everyone. while on earth omega, mister bones was revealed to have shot down cameron chase ship and says that he made a deal with darkseid to spare their earth in exchange for others. jade knocks down mister bones. after darkseid has teleported all the heroes off of earth omega and back to their respectful earths, mister bones was mentioned to have gotten away upon being returned to prime-earth. bones\\' mother\\'s exposure to mutagenic drugs during pregnancy gave him three superhuman powers, two of which are extremely inconvenient to his daily life: first, his skin (which, it has been indicated, would otherwise be black), flesh, and organs are all transparent, giving him the appearance of a denuded skeleton (thus his name); second, his skin constantly exudes a cyanide-based compound (in effect a toxic sweat), which is almost invariably lethal to anyone who touches him (as a corollary, he is immune to cyanide poisoning); third, he possesses superhuman strength. mister bones is featured in the smallville season 11 digital comic based on the tv series. during world war ii, the man who would become mister bones was a member of, and presumably the leader of, a government task force codenamed \"shadowpact\", created to counter the axis thule society. other members included felix faust and john zatara, though the latter left the team after their first mission. at some point, shadowpact came into contact with the olympian god hades, who promised them eternal youth if they aided him in escaping from the prison he had been sealed in by his brother, zeus, and the queen of the amazon tribe, hippolyta. bones could not fulfill his end of the bargain and was punished by the ancient deity, who used magic to turn bones\\' skin, muscles and organs invisible and stain his bones black, giving the agent the appearance of a walking skeleton. in the present, bones is the head of the government agency d.e.o. and uses a weekly treatment with body paint to appear normal and carry out day-to-day matters. mister bones appears in the cw live-action television series stargirl, voiced by keith david. this version is the director of the helix institute for youth rehabilitation. after being alluded to in the episode \"summer school: chapter ten\", his subordinate nurse louise love informs him of blue valley\\'s super-powered individuals and he makes plans to visit it in the episode \"summer school: chapter thirteen\". crematogaster cornigera is a species of ant in tribe

hungarian dramatic soprano. guszalewicz was born in budapest, and in 1896, at the age of seventeen, married opera singer eugen guszalewicz. she studied with her husband and made her debut in 1903 at the theater of bern, in switzerland. in 1905, she sang at the cologne opera as the queen of sheba in la reine de saba by gounod, and as isolde in wagner\\'s masterpiece. shortly after her role in tristan, she was offered a six-year contract to sing in cologne. guszalewicz continued to sing in cologne until 1916 and toured throughout europe. she also sang in several operas and gave recitals in karlsruhe (1906), düsseldorf (1907), bremen (1908) and dresden (1908). in dresden at the semperoper, she performed the title role in salome for the first time. her interpretation of salome caused a sensation. for many years, however, a picture of her performance was thought to in fact show the play\\'s author, wilde in women\\'s drag. the picture was even reproduced in richard ellmann\\'s biography of him. it was not until wilde\\'s grandson merlin holland corrected scholars in 1994 that the picture in fact showed guszalewicz. this correction undermined readings of wilde as a cross-dresser. she performed at the leipzig opera (1908), at the vienna state opera (1910 in the role of salome), at the berlin state opera (1911 as brünnhilde and as isolde), as well as in brussels, paris and madrid. in 1905, she sang the lead role in isidore de lara\\'s opera messaline in cologne, which was a great success for her. the opera had 27 performances. guszalewicz gave concerts at the opera in frankfurt am main (1907), at the stadttheater of bremen (1908) and at the national theatre munich (1910 as salome). her repertoire included the roles of leonore in fidelio, adriano in rienzi, venus in tannhäuser, the title role of ingwelde in max von schillings\\' opera, elektra (opera) in the opera of richard strauss, berthe in le prophète by meyerbeer, santuzza in cavalleria rusticana, the title role in mascagni\\'s amica, and maria in a basso porto by niccola spinelli. after ending her career, she worked as a teacher in munich. her daughter genia guszalewicz (1902–71) became one of her students, and she followed her mother into a career as an opera singer. alice guszalewicz died at the age of 61 in munich, germany. gordon marion graham (february 16, 1918 – march 22, 2008) was a

email content and user data before they are sent to proton mail servers, unlike other common email providers such as gmail and outlook.com. the service can be accessed through a webmail client, the tor network, or dedicated ios and android apps. proton mail is run by proton ag (formerly proton technologies), which is based in the canton of geneva. the company also operates proton vpn, proton drive and proton calendar. proton mail received initial funding through a crowdfunding campaign. although the default account setup is free, the service is sustained by optional paid services. initial membership was by invitation only, however beginning in march 2016, proton mail was opened to the public. acquiring no fewer than 2 million users by 2017, membership grew to almost 70 million by 2022. on 16 may 2014, proton mail entered into public beta. it was met with enough response that after three days they needed to temporarily suspend beta signups to expand server capacity. two months later, proton mail received us$550,377 from 10,576 donors through a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo, while aiming for us$100,000. during the campaign, paypal froze proton mail\\'s paypal account, thereby preventing the withdrawal of us$251,721 worth of donations. paypal stated that the account was frozen due to doubts of the legality of encryption, statements that opponents said were unfounded. the restrictions were lifted the following day. on 18 march 2015, proton mail received us$2 million from the non-profit fondation genevoise pour l\\'innovation technologique (fongit) and charles river ventures, although by 2022, the company no longer had venture capital investors. on 14 august 2015, proton mail released major version 2.0, which included a rewritten codebase for its web interface. on 17 march 2016, proton mail released major version 3.0, which saw the official launch of proton mail out of beta. with a new interface for the web client, version 3.0 also included the public launch of proton mail\\'s ios and android beta applications. on 19 january 2017, proton mail announced a tor onion site. on 21 november 2017, proton mail introduced proton mail contacts, a zero-access encryption contacts manager. proton mail contacts also utilizes digital signatures to verify the integrity of contacts data. on 6 december 2017, proton mail launched proton mail bridge, an application that provides end-to-end email encryption to any desktop client that supports imap and smtp, such as microsoft outlook, mozilla thunderbird, and apple mail, for windows and macos. on 25 july 2018, proton mail introduced address verification and pretty good privacy (pgp) support, making proton mail interoperable with other pgp clients. the source code for the back-end remains closed source. however, proton mail released the source code for the web interface under an open-source license. proton mail also open sourced their mobile clients for ios and android, as well the proton mail bridge app. all of their source code can be found on github. in september 2020, proton mail helped found the coalition for app fairness, which aims to gain better conditions for the inclusion of their apps in app stores. proton also founded the coalition for competitive digital markets, which brings together 50+ european tech companies supporting open, interoperable and competitive digital markets. in may 2022, proton ag updated the visuals, user interface, and logos of all its products, including proton mail, to achieve a consistent design throughout its software. proton mail\\'s subscription now includes access to all proton vpn, proton calendar, and proton drive. proton mail uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to offer end-to-end encryption. when a user creates a proton mail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private rsa keys: this symmetrical encryption happens in the user\\'s web browser using aes-256. upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account. proton mail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode that requires a login password and a mailbox password. upon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. this is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. the decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. the public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on proton mail servers. thus proton mail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so proton mail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords. this system absolves proton mail from: proton mail exclusively supports https and uses tls with ephemeral key exchange to encrypt all internet traffic between users and proton mail servers. proton mail holds an \"a+\" rating from qualys ssl labs. in september 2015, proton mail added native support to their web interface and mobile app for pgp. this allows a user to export their proton mail pgp-encoded public key to others outside of proton mail, enabling them to use the key for email encryption. the proton mail also supports pgp encryption from proton mail to outside users. proton mail also has support for searching within encrypted message content. an email message sent from one proton mail account to another is automatically encrypted with the public key of the recipient. once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the message. when the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox. email messages sent from proton mail to non-proton mail email addresses may optionally be sent in plain text or with end-to-end encryption. with encryption, the message is encrypted with aes under a user-supplied password. the recipient receives a link to the proton mail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted message. proton mail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a backchannel. such email messages can be set to self-destruct after a period of time. both proton mail and proton vpn are located in switzerland to avoid any surveillance or information requests from countries under the fourteen eyes, and/or under government surveillance laws like the united states\\' patriot act or outside the bounds of law.[citation needed] the company claims that it is also located in switzerland because of its strict privacy laws. proton mail currently supports two-factor authentication with totp tokens for its login process. as of october 2019, according to the official proton mail blog, u2f support for yubikey and fido physical security keys is currently under development and will be available soon after the release of v4.0. in 2021, proton mail\\'s security and cryptographic architecture were both independently audited by securitum, a leading european security auditing company, who uncovered no major issues or security vulnerabilities, and the audit results were publicly published. proton mail limits data portability by locking support for external email client software through imap and pop3 protocols behind a paywall. as of 2021, users are unable to back up their email account locally without paying. proton mail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party. it maintains two data centres, one in lausanne and another in attinghausen (in the former k7 military bunker under 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) of granite) as a backup. since the servers are located in switzerland, they are legally outside of the jurisdiction of the european union, united states, and other countries. under swiss law, all surveillance requests from foreign countries must go through a swiss court and are subject to international treaties. prospective surveillance targets are promptly notified and can appeal the request in court. each data centre uses load balancing across web, mail, and sql servers, redundant power supply, hard drives with full disk encryption, and exclusive use of linux and other open-source software. in december 2014, proton mail joined the ripe ncc in an effort to have more direct control over the surrounding internet infrastructure. from 3 to 7 november 2015, proton mail was under several ddos attacks that made the service largely unavailable to users. during the attacks, the company stated on twitter that it was looking for a new data center in switzerland, saying, \"many are afraid due to the magnitude of the attack against us\". in july 2018, proton mail reported it was once more suffering from ddos attacks. ceo andy yen claimed that the attackers had been paid by an unknown party to launch the attacks. in september 2018, one of the suspected proton mail attackers was arrested by british law enforcement and charged in connection with a series of other high-profile cyberattacks against schools and airlines. on 22 april 2020, proton mail confirmed on its proton vpn twitter that proton mail and proton vpn are banned in china because it doesn\\'t allow the government to spy. on 15 november 2019, proton confirmed that government of the republic of belarus had issued a block across the country of proton mail and proton vpn ip addresses. the block was no longer in place four days later. no explanation was given to proton mail for the block, nor for the block being lifted. on 29 january 2020, the russian federal service for supervision of communications, information technology and mass media reported that it had implemented a complete block of proton mail services within the russian federation. as a reason for the block, it cited proton mail\\'s refusal to give up information relating to accounts that allegedly sent out spam with terror threats. however, proton mail claimed that it did not receive any requests from russian authorities regarding any such accounts. in response to the block, the proton mail twitter account recommended legitimate users circumvent the block via vpns or tor. in march 2020, the company announced that even though the russia ban was not particularly successful and the service continues to be largely available in russia without utilising a vpn, proton mail will be releasing new anti-censorship features in both proton mail and proton vpn desktop and mobile apps which will allow more block attempts to be automatically circumvented. according to proton mail\\'s transparency report, it is legally obligated to follow swiss court orders if swiss law is broken, and in 2020 proton mail received 3,572 orders from swiss authorities and contested 750 of them. due to the encryption utilized, proton mail is unable to hand over the contents of encrypted emails under any circumstances, but according to proton\\'s privacy policy, proton mail can be legally compelled to log ip addresses as part of a swiss criminal investigation. for this reason, the company strongly suggests that users who need to hide their identity from the swiss government use their tor hidden service/onion site. in may 2022, proton updated its privacy policy and made explicit a separate privacy policy for its proton vpn service, which has a different treatment under swiss law and has a strict no-logs policy which was also confirmed by an external audit. notable cases involving swiss court orders include a case involving death threats made against well-known immunologist anthony fauci and a case against french citizens charged with theft and destruction of property. after these cases, in october 2021, proton mail won an important swiss court victory that confirmed that email services cannot be considered telecommunications providers, and consequently are not subject to the data retention requirements imposed on telecommunications providers. as of 25 may 2022[update], proton mail offers the following account types: [c 2] the case method is a teaching approach that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. it developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the casebook method of teaching law pioneered by harvard legal scholar christopher c. langdell. in sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question. rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case. the case method evolved from the casebook method, a mode of teaching based on socratic principles pioneered at harvard law school by christopher c. langdell. like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem. a decision-forcing case is a kind of decision game. like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem. however, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events. a decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study. that is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past. however, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\" this is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision. in other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. in recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations. it is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. it has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. every decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve. thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play. some case teachers, such as those of the marine corps university, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case. (a student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"your majesty, what are your orders?\") other case teachers, such as those at the harvard business school, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\" after discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case. also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at harvard university) \"the \\'b\\' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist. whatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\" rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions. some case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students. one reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case. another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes kirsten lundgren of columbia university, \"can be all the more powerful when the \\'what happened\\' is left unanswered. a classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time. there are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems. a decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\" also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"staff rides\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the united states army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (stabs reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by gerhard von scharnhorst in 1801 and made famous by the elder hellmuth von moltke in the middle years of the nineteenth century. to avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the case method project at the marine corps university in quantico, virginia, adopted the term \"russell ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts. the term is an homage to major general john henry russell jr.,usmc, the 16th commandant of the united states marine corps and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. decision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches. in this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve. a decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\" (the bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an \"open-face\" or \"smørrebrød\" case. a decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions in a relatively short period of time is sometimes called a \"white castle\", \"slider\" case. or \"day in the life\" case. case materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case. commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs. case materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case. materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting. materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (these are called \"the b-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\") materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting. (these are often referred to as \"handouts.\") case materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. these include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts. a number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials. these organizations include: the case centre (formerly the european case clearing house), headquartered in cranfield university, cranfield, bedford, united kingdom, and with its us office at babson college, wellesley, massachusetts, is the independent home of the case method. it is a membership-based organization with more than 500 members worldwide, not-for-profit organisation and registered charity founded in 1973. the case centre is the world’s largest and most diverse repository of case studies used in management education, with cases from the world’s top case publishing schools, including, harvard business school, icfai business school hyderabad, insead, imd, ivey business school, darden school of business, london business school, etc. its stated aim is to promote the case method by sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise in this area among teachers and students, and for this it engages in various activities like conducting case method workshops, offering case scholarships, publishing a journal, and organizing a global case method awards. the case centre awards (known as the european awards from 1991 and 2010) recognises outstanding case writers and teachers worldwide. these prestigious awards, popularly known as the case method community\\'s annual \\'oscars\\', or the “business education oscars, celebrate worldwide excellence in case writing and teaching. the presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem. this can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story. this, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\" that is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. techniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials; awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" – information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case. the case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. in the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right. by exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters. by placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures. by providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue. by providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement. by asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession. in his classic essay on the case method (\"because wisdom can\\'t be told\"), charles i. gragg of the harvard business school argued that \"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\" while the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement. these incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to: thomas w. shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. the instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. with this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\" case materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \"best practices\" fallacies. here are some examples of such disclaimers: the case method is used in a variety of professional schools. these include the: university of fujairah- mba program melissa siegel (born 8 april 1981) is an american academic specialising in migration. she is professor of migration studies at the maastricht

archdiocese of new york, located in dover plains, dutchess county, new york. it was founded in 1866 as a mission of immaculate conception parish of amenia. in 1885 it became a mission of st. john the evangelist\\'s church in pawling, and was finally itself elevated to parish status in 1936. dover plains was a branch mission served first by father michael riordan, pastor of st. peter\\'s, poughkeepsie; then later by denis sheehan, pastor of st. mary\\'s, wappingers falls. in 1859 archbishop hughes appointed rev. charles slevin, as the first resident priest. father slavin became responsible for the whole harlem valley. he resided at dover plains and built the church there. dover plains was chosen as the headquarters for the missions of amenia, beekman, millbrook, millerton, and pawling, where there were no churches. it was father slevin who built st. charles\\' church. he was drafted during the civil war, but his congregation made up the $300 fee to gain his exemption. father slevin left in 1864. his successor, rev. john arsenigo lived in purdy\\'s station. in 1886 father tandy became resident pastor at immaculate conception in amenia, with pawling and dover as missions. with the appointment in 1872 of father healy to st. john the evangelist responsibility for st. charles\\' mission was transferred to pawling. in september 2018, timothy cardinal dolan, archbishop of new york, officially decreed the merger of st. john the evangelist with st. charles borromeo, creating the new parish church of st. john the evangelist-st. charles borromeo. the main parish office is now located in pawling, ny. each church retains its own sunday mass schedule but is served now under one pastor.[citation needed] our lady of solace chapel in nearby wingdale was part of st. charles borromeo parish in dover plains until 2013. the mission chapel was established in 1962 and staffed by capuchin friars. the main purpose of the mission was to serve those at the psychiatric hospital in wingdale—the hospital closed in the 1994, but a juvenile detention center remained open directly across from the church. our lady of solace mission was closed in december 2012 and the property is now owned by olivet management, the corporate name of olivet university. loaves & fishes ministry is a program started by the sisters of the divine compassion, providing companionship, food, and language tutoring to the residents of dover plains and wingdale. the elderly and homebound of the dover plains area are the ministry\\'s target population. loaves & fishes operates the food pantry. this pantry, stocked by the parishioners of st. charles and area residents, provides free food to low-income families of dover plains and wingdale. visiting, transport to doctor\\'s offices and hospitals are provided by volunteers. the loaves and fishes works with local agencies, civic groups and the local parish to identify those in need. it also operates a \"backpack program\" providing some elementary school children with backpacks of food for the weekend. the european squadron, also known as the european station, was a part of the united states navy in the late 19th century and the early 1900s. the squadron was originally named the mediterranean squadron and renamed following the american civil war. in 1905, the squadron was absorbed into the north atlantic fleet. the egyptian expedition in june and july 1882 was a response by the united states to the british and french attack on alexandria during the anglo-egyptian war. to protect american citizens and their property within the city, ships of the european squadron, under rear admiral james nicholson, were sent to egypt with orders to observe the conflict ashore and make a landing if necessary. british and french forces heavily damaged the city and started a large fire so a force of marines and sailors were landed and they assisted in fire fighting and guarding the american consulate from insurgents. casper f. goodrich, who served as an executive officer on the uss lancaster, commanded the landing party and would later publish an extensive report on the bombardment. the european squadron returned to u.s. waters at the start of the spanish–american war in april 1898, and did not return to europe until july 1901, when admiral bartlett j. cromwell was placed in command with the cruiser uss chicago as flagship. other ships of the squadron from july 1901 included the cruiser uss albany and the gunboat uss nashville. ikinu is a small town in kenya\\'s central province. ikinu

0.01101001100101101001011001101001... is given by the thue–morse sequence. that is, where tn is the nth element of the prouhet–thue–morse sequence. the prouhet–thue–morse constant can also be expressed, without using tn , as an infinite product, this formula is obtained by substituting x = 1/2 into generating series for tn the continued fraction expansion of the constant is [0; 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 44, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, …] (sequence a014572 in the oeis) yann bugeaud and martine queffélec showed that infinitely many partial quotients of this continued fraction are 4 or 5, and infinitely many partial quotients are greater than or equal to 50. the prouhet–thue–morse constant was shown to be transcendental by kurt mahler in 1929. he also showed that the number is also transcendental for any algebraic number α, where 0 < |α| < 1. yann bugaeud proved that the prouhet–thue–morse constant has an irrationality measure of 2. the prouhet–thue–morse constant appears in

(פני מנחם), after the works he authored, was the seventh rebbe of the hasidic dynasty of ger, a position he held from 1992 until his death in 1996. from 1956 until he was appointed rebbe, he was a rosh yeshiva. he also served as a member and the president of the torah scholars council and as the chairman of the agudat yisrael political party. pinchas menachem was born in falenica, near warsaw, poland. he was the only offspring of the second marriage of his father, rabbi avraham mordechai alter, the fourth rebbe of ger, to feyge mintshe biderman. pinchas menachem had four half-brothers and two half-sisters from his father\\'s first marriage—including the fifth rebbe of ger, rabbi yisrael alter, and rabbi simcha bunim alter, the sixth rebbe of ger. pinchas menachem\\'s bar mitzva took place near ludmir in poland (now western ukraine) not long before the outbreak of world war ii in 1939. after the war, he married his cousin, tzipora alter. in 1956, he was appointed rosh yeshiva of sfas emes, the flagship yeshiva of ger in jerusalem, israel. rabbi pinchas menachem succeeded his half-brother, rabbi simcha bunim alter, to become rebbe in 1992. his position as rosh yeshiva of sfas emes yeshiva was assumed by his son, rabbi shaul alter, who is widely regarded as an eminent talmudic scholar. during his tenure, rabbi pinchas menachem continued the policies of his half-brothers, rabbi simcha bunim and rabbi yisrael, by supporting the political work of the agudat israel of israel party, promoting the interests of haredi judaism in the israeli knesset. he reached a rapprochement with his non-hasidic ashkenazi haredi fellow-rabbis, in particular with rabbi elazar shach, leader of the rival degel hatorah party. together, they created the united torah judaism (yahadut hatorah) party in order not to lose residual votes in the israeli proportional representation system, and thereby potentially obtain an extra seat for the newly united party in knesset elections. rabbi pinchas menachem died in 1996 after less than four years at the helm of the ger dynasty. he was buried beside his father, rabbi avraham mordechai alter, in the courtyard of the sfas emes yeshiva. unlike his father\\'s grave, which was dug by hand under the cover of darkness during the british curfew in 1948, the pnei menachem\\'s grave was dug with machinery; the latter grave is therefore lower than the former. a red-brick ohel was built over the two graves, which are visited frequently by students in the yeshiva. he was succeeded as rebbe by his nephew, rabbi yaakov aryeh alter, son of rabbi simcha bunim alter. in 2019 his son rabbi shaul alter formed his own followership of ger chasidim called kehilas pnei menachem which is independent of the greater ger sect. bixin is an apocarotenoid found in the seeds of the achiote tree (bixa orellana) from which it derives its name. it is commonly extracted from the seeds to form annatto, a natural food coloring, containing about 5% pigments of which 70-80% are bixin. bixin is chemically unstable when isolated and converts via isomerization into trans-bixin (β-bixin), the double-bond isomer. bixin is soluble in fats and alcohols but insoluble in water. upon exposure to alkali, the methyl ester is hydrolyzed to produce the dicarboxylic acid norbixin, a water-soluble derivative. robert a. lanier (born july 24, 1968) is

is a natural region of southern-central sardinia, italy. etymology the name \"marmilla\" comes from the vast rounded hills, probably resembling udders (see marmilla castle in las plassas). another hypothesis is that according to which given the presence of many marshes in the area, the landscape could appear dotted with \"a thousand seas\". tourism in the marmilla can rely on various factors ranging from environmental assets, to the numerous nuragic centers in the area, to architectural works. in particular, we note: environmental assets: giara of gesturi monte arci natural park nuragic centers: nuragic village of su nuraxi in barumini, nuraghe cuccurada in mogoro, archaeological area nuraghe sa fogaia in siddi tomb of the giants \"sa domu e s\\'orcu\" in siddi genna maria complex in

it is delimited from east and south by the campidano, from north-west by monte arci, from north by the giara di gesturi and the giara di serri, and from east by the flumini mannu. geologically, most of marmilla dates to the miocene period, and is thus substantially younger than the rest of sardinia. the landscape is mostly hilly, and human economical activities in the area include agriculture (prevalently cereals and fava beans) and tourism. marmilla was inhabited since prehistoric times, as testified by the presence of nuraghe. to the carthaginian domination date the fortress of genoni. during the middle ages it was part of the giudicato of arborea and of the giudicato of cagliari. coordinates: .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output

\"bursting apart\") is the 82nd sura of the qur\\'an, with 19 ayat. the chapter is named \\'al-infitar\\' because of the occurrence of the word \\'unfatarat\\' in the first verse of this chapter. infitar means \\'split asunder\\': the word \\'unfatarat\\' is used in this chapter in order to describe the splitting of the sky on the day of judgment. this chapter (al-infitar), along with chapters at-takwir and al-inshiqaq, provides an exhaustive description about the \\'day of judgment\\'. the first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the qur\\'an is found in hadith of prophet muhammad. although scholars including ibn taymiyyah claim that muhammad has commented on the whole of the qur\\'an, others including ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the qur\\'an. ḥadīth (حديث) is literally \"speech\" or \"report\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of muhammad validated by isnad; with sirah rasul allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. according to aishah, the life of prophet muhammad was practical implementation of qur\\'an. therefore, mention in hadith elevates the importance of the pertinent surah from a certain perspective. nechama tec (née bawnik) (born 15 may 1931) is a professor emerita of sociology at the university of connecticut. she received her ph.d. in sociology at columbia university,

completed a number of fine works of his own including the performing arts centre in esbjerg. born on 27 september 1944 in stockholm, utzon was brought up first at hellebæk near helsingør in the north of zealand until the family moved to australia in 1957. he studied at the school of architecture in sydney (1964–66) and at the royal danish academy of fine arts in copenhagen (1966–1970). deeply influenced by his father\\'s approach to architecture, jan utzon soon began to collaborate with him taking on key supervisory tasks in major projects such as the kuwait national assembly building. in many cases, it is difficult to estimate to division of responsibility in projects undertaken by utzon associates where jan worked both with his father and his brother kim. these include the paustian house in copenhagen and the skagen odde nature centre in the north of jutland. jan also set up his own design office on funen where he authored many interesting projects. one of his most successful is the performing arts centre in esbjerg (1997) with its theatre and concert hall combined with the earlier art museum. its large communal foyer catering both to the concert hall and the museum is particularly appealing and was achieved on a modest budget. utzon architects and johnson pilton walker, architects in collaboration, have explored options to improve the existing opera theatre at the sydney opera house. utzon has also been active in the developing countries. working for tvind, he built the shamva, zimbabwe, headquarters for the humana people to people organisation, as well as a large training and conference centre at san juan de las pulgas near ensenada in mexico\\'s baja california (2008). paustian house, copenhagen, in collaboration with jørn utzon and kim utzon skagen odde nature centre, north jutland, in collaboration with jørn utzon the acanti are a race of fictional whale-like, extraterrestrial beings appearing in american comic books published by marvel comics. they have appeared in uncanny x-men within the marvel comics universe. they were created by writer chris claremont and artist dave cockrum. many of them were enslaved by the brood empire. the acanti roughly resemble whales. they are a reddish-brown color. they have dorsal, ventral, lateral, and caudal fins, as well as green eyes widely spaced on their heads. the acanti are large space-faring creatures most closely resembling earth\\'s whale shark. an adult acanti can grow to a few kilometers in length, and even an infant is large enough to swallow a 15-person spaceship with room to take in at least four more. they are sentient creatures which communicate through psionic sounds referred to as songs. acanti have the innate ability to fly faster than the speed of light, without technological assistance. according to myth, the acanti are an ancient species which peacefully wandered through space, benevolent and compassionate by nature. the acanti were led by one individual known as the prophet-singer. the prophet-singer was the repository of the acanti\\'s racial soul, a collective semi-mystical force that linked and motivated the acanti species. as death approached, the acanti typically hurled themselves into stars. the prophet-singer of each generation would also do so, releasing the soul to join the body of the next prophet-singer. upon migrating to the milky way galaxy, the brood began to enslave the acanti to take advantage of their natural ability to travel at speeds exceeding light. the brood would infect individual acanti with a disease known as the slaver virus, which would destroy the higher cognitive functions of their minds, making them ripe for easy control. then, the brood would transform the mindless husks into living starships. the brood succeeded in enslaving the acanti prophet-singer, and when he eventually died and crashed on a planet, its body was reconstructed as the \"throne city\" (presumably like a capital) on the planet (referred to as \"broodworld\" or \"sleazeworld\") that the brood then established as the center of their empire. thus, the soul remained trapped in the skull of the dead prophet-singer. salvation for the acanti came when a new prophet-singer was born, however, without transferring the soul to him, the acanti were still stuck near sleazeworld. during the x-men\\'s first conflict with the brood the x-men had been abducted and infected by the brood and brought to their homeworld. carol danvers (formerly ms. marvel) became linked with a white hole and transformed into binary. the process made her temporarily insane, and she blasted out of lilandra\\'s yacht, causing an explosive decompression that sucked storm into space, where she was found by the newborn prophet-singer, whose mother had just been enslaved by the brood. storm herself was now becoming a brood as the egg began to hatch. the prophet-singer saved storm (who had destroyed the egg and critically wounded herself). other acanti merged storm\\'s consciousness with that of the prophet-singer while storm\\'s body healed in a cocoon within him. the acanti saved storm, entering into a symbiotic relationship in which the acanti healed storm\\'s body, purging it of the brood embryo, and storm\\'s experienced mind provided a source of focus and strength for the baby prophet-singer. the acanti then swallowed liliandra\\'s yacht, masking it from brood sensors while the crew effected repairs. the x-men then agreed to release the soul from broodworld. after a battle against the brood, binary succeeded in releasing the soul from the crystalline room in which it was trapped. the foul nature of the brood queen and the embryos within the x-men immediately resonated as black pools throughout the chamber. the grateful soul purged the x-men of the brood embryos and transformed the brood queen into pure inanimate crystal. the soul united with the young prophet-singer, who assumed leadership of the acanti. recently, however, the brood attempted to invade earth using a fleet of acanti ships, though ones without external domes. it is unknown whether these were leftovers from before the x-men freed the prophet-singer, or whether the brood have continued their depredations on the acanti even afterwards. the fleet was scared away from earth with a telepathic illusion of the phoenix force and galactus. one acanti was obtained by roxxon energy corporation. with a riding device added to it, the acanti was controlled by an unidentified brood-infected human working for dario agger in his plot to hire weapon h into working for roxxon. weapon h used his punch to defeat the acanti. although not named, in the ultimate fantastic four #35 (dec. 2006) there is a huge alien creature, used by the acheron empire, ruled by thanos, that resembles the acanti. an acanti appears in the x-men episode \"love in vain\". enslaved by the brood (here called \"the colony\") to be their vessel, it is freed when professor x uses his psychic powers to break the brood\\'s control. the brood cannot stand the acanti\\'s song while the x-man rogue finds it beautiful. ren (katherine) powell (born karen lee tudor in

between the communities of hondo and glencoe. it is just east of the lincoln national forest. the community is the site of san patricio retreat center, a benedictine spirituality center recently purchased by the diocese of las cruces, new mexico. the hurd-larinconada gallery, owned by artist michael hurd, is located here. the gallery displays original works of art by the wyeth and hurd families and there are guest houses on the ranch. in the 1850s, hispanic settlers moved to the area, which caused conflict with the native apache. according to an interview with frank coe, these settlers lived in placitas, or \"adobe family compounds enclosed for defensive purposes.\" some still survive in the 21st century. historic documents collected by the new mexico department of transportation note: in his book frontier fighter, george coe describes the late 1800s houses in san patricio as being \"built for defense with thick adobe walls and portholes on top.\" robery utley\\'s book high noon in lincoln describes san patricio in the 1870s as made up of \"some 15 adobe buildings scattered along a single street.\" in the following decades, european-american settlers began to move here as well. the town was estimated to have about 40 families in 1867. that year the first acequia in the hondo valley was dug in san patricio. around 1870, the town was named ruidoso after the nearby river. several years later it was renamed after a catholic church built here: la iglesia de san patricio. this church, also known as the san patricio catholic church, was the first church in the area. it became an important cultural center for the residents. similar churches of this type are found throughout the hondo valley. san patricio was the site of a battle in the lincoln county war. it was associated with billy the kid, who attended dances in town during the 1870s. in 1878, james dolan and his allies, including the rio grande posse, vandalized the town and stole and killed horses. by the 1920s, the population grew to 822. artists peter hurd and his wife henriette wyeth moved to the area in the 1930s, starting a farm of 40 acres. they were the first among numerous artists to live in the area and eventually had a 2200-acre ranch. during world war ii the population declined. postwar development followed highway construction, and businesses moved to follow the changing path of u.s. route 70. in 1967, st. jude\\'s church was built, consolidating the congregations of all nearby catholic churches in the hondo valley. the coordinates of san patricio are 33°24′32″n 105°19′37″w\\ufeff / \\ufeff33.40889°n 105.32694°w\\ufeff / 33.40889; -105.32694 (33.408976, -105.326928). the elevation is 5436 feet (1657 m). san patricio is located near the confluence of rio ruidoso and rio bonito. glencoe is to the west and hondo to the east. after their confluence, the rivers become the rio hondo. the catholic community in glencoe attends st. jude\\'s church in san patricio. this church incorporated the bells from the historical glencoe and hondo catholic churches, and san patricio church. u.s. route 70 serves the town, which is a 16.5 mile drive from sierra blanca regional airport. the community and region are known for growing apples; the orchards were a major part of the economy until the mid-1900s. other orchard fruits, like peaches, pears, and cherries, and more general agricultural products were also sold to truckers along with the apples. floods in 1941 and 1965, and the threat of cold weather have been the main dangers to these orchards. early businesses of san patricio included a general store, a grocery shop, a bar, a pool hall, a post office, and a gas station. in the early 2000s, only the post office is still operating. san patricio built its first school before 1880. the school district included 70 students in 1880 and 153 in 1920. the four-room elementary school closed in 1960 after the smaller school districts in the area consolidated to hondo\\'s elementary school. bride and groom is an old-time radio human-interest program in the united states. it was broadcast on abc from november 26, 1945 to september 15, 1950. each episode featured an engaged couple who would be married during the broadcast, then showered with gifts. in 1951, it was adapted as a television show of the same name. each episode centred on a couple engaged to be married. an episode would begin with host john nelson interviewing the couple, with questions about how the two met and their courtship. announcer jack mcelroy would sing a song for the couple, who would then exit to an adjacent chapel to be married by one of around 30 clergymen retained by the show. during the wedding ceremony, which was not recorded, nelson would chat with members of the audience. he would usually speak with married couples who were celebrating significant anniversary milestones, who would be given gifts such as matching wristwatches. after the

written by alan plater, the plot concerns the disappearance of the husband of leeds schoolteacher judy threadgold (bridget turner). investigating the disappearance, with the aid of her colleague, woodwork teacher neville keaton (alun armstrong), judy learns of the existence of a secret organisation that helps disaffected people leave their unhappy lives behind. alan plater\\'s the beiderbecke affair (1985) started out as a sequel to get lost! but was rewritten with new characters when alun armstrong proved unavailable to reprise the role of neville keaton. the plot of get lost! concerns the disappearance of jim threadgold (brian southwood), husband of english teacher judy threadgold (turner). aided by her colleague, woodwork teacher neville keaton (armstrong), judy sets out to find out what has happened to her husband. judy and neville soon discover the existence of a secret organisation dedicated to assisting people who want to escape the mundanity of their lives and families and just disappear. although judy eventually finds her missing husband, she is none too enthusiastic about taking him back and allows him to seek a new life running a fish and chip shop. her adversarial relationship with neville blossoms into a love affair. alan plater had begun writing for television in the early 1960s and had been a regular writer on the police series z-cars (1962–78) and its spin-off series softly, softly (1966–69) and softly, softly: taskforce (1969–76). he had also written several plays for the bbc and itv and created and wrote the sitcom oh no, it\\'s selwyn froggitt! (1974). plater\\'s scripts were noted for their strong depiction of the lives of the inhabitants of northern england. in 1978, plater was commissioned by david cunliffe, an executive producer at yorkshire television (ytv), to adapt j. b. priestley\\'s the good companions as a thirteen part serial. plater was only able to stretch the plot to fill nine episodes and so offered to write four episodes of what he called a \"non-violent thriller\" to make up the balance. using characters inspired by nick and nora charles, the detectives in the film the thin man (1934) and its sequels, plater sought to juxtapose the conventions of the hardboiled thriller, as expounded by the likes of raymond chandler and dashiell hammett, with the mundanity of life in yorkshire. the plot was inspired by a newspaper article that reported that 20,000 people went missing in the uk each year. in creating his two protagonists – neville keaton and judy threadgold (named after sunderland goalkeeper harry threadgold) – plater hit upon the idea of making them schoolteachers, saying, \"i tried to think of the least likely place to find two detectives and i came up with a staffroom of a comprehensive school in leeds\". plater apportioned elements of his own interests to his two heroes, making judy an environmental campaigner and neville a football and jazz fan. neville\\'s love of jazz is reflected in the serial\\'s soundtrack which features re-recordings, by frank ricotti and featuring kenny baker, of tracks by the likes of duke ellington. cast as neville keaton was alun armstrong who, at the time, had worked with the national theatre and the royal shakespeare company and would later go on to enjoy a varied television career with roles in such programmes as our friends in the north (1996), this is personal: the hunt for the yorkshire ripper (2000) and new tricks (2003–2013). judy threadgold was played by bridget turner, an actress best known for her stage work, especially works by alan ayckbourn, and had previously appeared in episodes of sutherland\\'s law (1973–76) and target (1977–78). the series was mainly filmed around the leeds area. settings included: get lost! aired to respectable ratings – averaging 10.9 million viewers across its run – and plater soon began work on a sequel. when it transpired than alun armstrong would not be available to reprise the role of neville keaton, plater decided that, rather than recasting the role, he would create two new characters and rewrite the scripts. the sequel to get lost! was reworked by plater into what was to become the beiderbecke affair (1985), the first serial in what was to become known as the beiderbecke trilogy. get lost! was released on region 2 dvd by network in 2006 as an extra in a box-set release of the beiderbecke trilogy. the moscow jewish film festival is an annual international film festival, which aims to gather in the program features, documentaries, shorts and animated films on

upham as the gesture that was to accompany the american pledge of allegiance, which had been written by francis bellamy. it was also known as the \"flag salute\" during the period when it was used with the pledge of allegiance. bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. both the pledge and its salute originated in 1892. later, during the 1920s and 1930s, italian fascists and nazi germans adopted a salute which was very similar, erroneously attributed to the roman salute, a gesture that was popularly believed to have been used in ancient rome. this resulted in controversy over the use of the bellamy salute in the united states. it was officially replaced by the hand-over-heart salute when congress amended the flag code on december 22, 1942. the inventor of the bellamy salute was james b. upham, junior partner and editor of the youth\\'s companion. bellamy recalled that upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said, \"now up there is the flag; i come to salute; as i say \"i pledge allegiance to my flag,\" i stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while i say the stirring words that follow.\" the bellamy salute was first demonstrated on october 12, 1892, according to bellamy\\'s published instructions for the \"national school celebration of columbus day\": at a signal from the principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the flag. another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute – right hand lifted, palm downward, to align with the forehead and close to it. standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, \"i pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" at the words, \"to my flag,\" the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side.in the 1920s, italian fascists adopted what has been called the roman salute to symbolize their claim to have revitalized italy on the model of ancient rome. a similar ritual was adopted by the german nazis, creating the nazi salute. controversy grew in the united states on the use of the bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes. school boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity. there was a counter-backlash from the united states flag association and the daughters of the american revolution, who felt it inappropriate for americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture. from 1939 until the attack on pearl harbor, detractors of americans who argued against intervention in world war ii produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those americans\\' reputations. among the anti-interventionist americans was aviation pioneer charles lindbergh. the pictures of him appearing to do the nazi salute are actually pictures of him using the bellamy salute. in his pulitzer prize-winning biography lindbergh (1998), author a. scott berg explains that interventionist propagandists would photograph lindbergh and other isolationists using this salute from an angle that left out the american flag, so it would be indistinguishable to observers from the nazi salute. on june 22, 1942, at the urging of the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars, congress passed public law 77-623, which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. this included the use of a palm-out salute, specifically that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words \\'to the flag\\' and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.\" congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. congress later amended the code on december 22, 1942, when it passed public law 77-829, stating among other changes, that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.\" the 1971–72 season was the 48th season in the existence of aek athens f.c. and the 13th consecutive season in the top flight of greek football. they competed in the alpha ethniki, the greek cup and the european cup. the season began on 29 august 1971 and finished on 11 june 1972. after the distinctions of the previous years, aek seemed to operate in a \"frantic tempo\", until this season, which was the passing to a declining period for the team. the team\\'s roster was constantly renewed as a generation of players left, passing the torch to the next one. the new generation was consisted of great and talented players, however the club was not ready to claim a leading role in the league. aek participated in the european cup. the draw was tough for aek, as from the very first round faced one of the greastest european clubs over time, the great internazionale of ivano bordon, giacinto facchetti and sandro mazzola. the first match at san siro in front of almost 80,000 spectators, aek managed to take the lead at the 14th minute with pomonis, but inter\\'s superiority was obvious and after equalizing 5 minutes later, they finished the first half leading by 3–1. the second half turned out to be a standard procedure with inter raising the score to 4–1 and likewise the few chances of aek qualifying disappeared. in the rematch at the crowded aek stadium no one expected what was about to happen. everything started wrong for the yellow-blacks, as they were left behind the score at the 17th minute with a goal by mazzola. bertini\\'s dismissal two minutes later and stankovic\\'s offensive style, brought aek in taking the lead at the half time with ventouris and papaioannou, while also having two shoots hit the post. the italians, wanting if nothing else not to lose, chased the goal and equalized with boninsegna at the 76th minute. the players of aek, realizing that the qualification was lost definitively, sought the victory and achieved it with a goal by nikolaidis at the 89th minute, that made the final 3–2. one of the greatest victories for the then \"poor\" greek football and the first great european night for aek. in the league they finished third with 6 points from the top. this season was one of the worst for the club\\'s history for the greek cup. a very important year for the development of the tournament, as the amateur teams of the local legal associations cease to participate and only the teams of the national divisions could participate. the ties of the first round competed again according to geographical criteria, while from the second round onwards the draw was free. aek easily overcame pao rouf in the first round and kozani in the second round, but in the round of 16 they faced lamia, who to everyone\\'s surprise, eliminated them with 1–0 at the extra time. note: the players are the ones that have been announced by the aek athens\\' press release. no edits should be made unless a player arrival or exit is announced. updated 30 june 1972,

critic scott yanow as \"the definitive swing pianist\", wilson had a sophisticated, elegant style. his work was featured on the records of many of the biggest names in jazz, including louis armstrong, lena horne, benny goodman, billie holiday, and ella fitzgerald. with goodman, he was one of the first black musicians to appear prominently with white musicians. in addition to his extensive work as a sideman, wilson also led his own groups and recording sessions from the late 1920s to the 1980s. wilson was born in austin, texas. he studied piano and violin at tuskegee institute in tuskegee, alabama. after working in speed webb\\'s band, with louis armstrong, and also understudying earl hines in hines\\'s grand terrace cafe orchestra, wilson joined benny carter\\'s chocolate dandies in 1933. in 1935, he joined the benny goodman trio (which consisted of goodman, wilson and drummer gene krupa, later expanded to the benny goodman quartet with the addition of lionel hampton). the trio performed during the big band\\'s intermissions. by joining the trio, wilson became one of the first black musicians to perform prominently in a racially integrated group. jazz producer and writer john hammond was instrumental in getting wilson a contract with brunswick, starting in 1935, to record hot swing arrangements of the popular songs of the day, with the growing jukebox trade in mind. he recorded hit records with singers such as lena horne, helen ward and billie holiday. during these years, he also took part in many sessions with swing musicians such as lester young, roy eldridge, charlie shavers, red norvo, buck clayton, and ben webster. from 1936 to 1942, he recorded for brunswick records and columbia records. in the 1950s he recorded on verve records. wilson formed his own short-lived big band in 1939, then led a sextet at café society from 1940 to 1944. he was dubbed the \"marxist mozart\" by howard \"stretch\" johnson due to his support for left-wing causes: he performed in benefit concerts for the new masses journal and for russian war relief, and he chaired the artists\\' committee to elect benjamin j. davis (a new york city council member running on the communist party usa ballot line). in the 1950s, wilson taught at the juilliard school. wilson can be seen appearing as himself in the motion pictures hollywood hotel (1937) and the benny goodman story (1955). he also worked as music director for the dick cavett show. wilson lived quietly in suburban hillsdale, new jersey. he was married three times, including to the songwriter irene kitchings. he performed as a soloist and with pickup groups until the final years of his life, including leading a trio with his sons theodore wilson on bass and steven wilson on drums. in 1979, wilson was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from berklee college of music. wilson died of stomach cancer in new britain, connecticut, on july 31, 1986, aged 73. he is buried at fairview cemetery in new britain. in

an egyptian artist and muralist based in luxor, egypt. awad is an egyptian artist and is also known for his public murals in cairo and luxor, egypt. he is well known for his murals created on mohamed mahmoud street in cairo, egypt in 2012 during the egyptian revolution, which took media attention. his public murals and paintings encompass the history, dignity and charisma of the egyptian people. he has worked internationally, in both solo exhibitions for his oil paintings and outdoor public murals. awad began his collegiate studies at south valley university, faculty of fine arts in luxor, egypt and graduated in 2004 with a bachelor of arts. afterwards, he began his masters studies at helwan university, college of fine arts in zamalek, egypt, while at the same time serving as an assistant lecturer for south valley university, faculty of fine arts in luxor egypt. during these years, awad spent time between both universities and graduated with a master of arts in 2012. currently, he is a phd candidate and serves as an assistant lecturer in the department of mural painting, for the faculty of fine arts, at south valley university in luxor, egypt. his murals and public art became well known in late 2011 and early 2012 after he took a break from teaching to paint a mural in cairo, in this moment the port said massacre unfolded which changed the course of his plans and shifted his mural into a memorial mural. what was meant to only be a short period of time in cairo became a much longer time for awad as he continued to paint new murals on mohamed mahmoud street in cairo. awad\\'s phd dissertation working title is, \"artistic vision inspired by the murals of war and peace in ancient egyptian art\" and is expected to be released in 2019. in regards to his murals, alaa chooses to paint with a brush and uses acrylic paints rather than using stencils and spray paints. his intricate paintings can sometimes take up to a week to complete, not only because of the materials he uses, but because of the complexity of his designs. awad paints in a neo-pharonic style, a style that harkens back to ancient egypt. his usage of the neo-pharonic style is meant to draw attention back to the rich, old egyptian traditions. this style aims to remind the egyptian people of their heritage and past, a reminder to stay true to their egyptian identity. his murals are typically multifaceted and multi-layered with each telling a different story. beyond the aforementioned unique style of painting, using a neo-pharaonic style aims to return the prominence of public murals in egypt. public murals have played a significant role in egyptian villages in the past, when each village had their own muralist. these muralists would essentially be storytellers of the village and would depict important events or celebrations through traditional imagery and symbolism. many of these same images can be seen in awad\\'s artwork today as he is inspired from the famous works of art from ancient egypt that may be seen in temples and museums. alaa awad is also inspired by other ancient egyptian intangible heritage forms still found in upper egypt such as tahtib (egyptian arabic: تحطيب taḥṭīb), el mormah and the daily life of the west bank in luxor, egypt. alaa awad\\'s public murals were created in cairo during the egyptian revolution and were painted on significant walls including temporary wall-like roadblock, built to keep protesters away from government buildings. in total, eight walls and seven roadblocks were constructed to keep protesters from tahrir square away from the ministry of the interior, ministry of justice, and parliament house. the paintings along mohamed mahmoud street reflect the juxtaposition between the ruling power and how their style of leadership has fueled the resistance. a major difference between awad\\'s public murals and the other street art is that awad\\'s art is much more subtle because of the neo-pharonic style of his works. while his works will oftentimes directly tie to a social issue, such as gas tank shortages or women\\'s rights, an underlying theme is that egyptians as a whole must remember their past culture and history stating that \"we can\\'t know our future if we forget our past.\" awad himself has indicated his own political beliefs stating that \"i don\\'t see any change in egypt\\'s politics, inside or out. i just see that the muslim brotherhood has captured the government. they want to change everything according to their own style, to make everything muslim brotherhood. they forget to improve things for the public. they have forgotten the people.\" the victory mosaic was designed by awad in luxor, egypt and was constructed with a team under the direction of awad. the team consisted of students and instructors from south valley university, faculty of fine arts, department of mural painting. it was inspired from the battle scenes found in ancient egyptian site habu temple. the material used to construct the mosaic was mosaic and glass. the approximate size is 6 x 4.8 meters. it was installed in late november 2017 on the sports hall building of south valley university campus in qena, egypt. the mosaic took one year to complete. marching women is a mural which consists of two main components, \"women in the funeral march\" and \"women climb the ladder\". this work is based on an original image in the ramesseum temple in west bank of luxor, a photo of engraved battle scenes on the ramesseum\\'s first pylon, thebes. the ramesseum has some of the egyptian world\\'s oldest surviving pylons. a pylon, or monumental portal to an ancient egyptian temple, usually consists of two massive upward tapering walls flanking and perpendicular to the temples entrance. awad changed it, his painting made women instead of men apparent to the viewer. this work shows the strong role that women played in society in the past of egypt and today. and we can see his meaning in the women\\'s hands—they have papyrus in their hands, this communicates the meaning of knowledge . this work, women climbing the ladder, was based on a scene located at the ramesseum temple in luxor, egypt. by placing this ancient image in a more modern context it demonstrates how instrumental women were in the past and also in the present. awad painted this piece to represent the role of women and stated the influence of the battle of kadesh in which it is located. in this court are well preserved scenes from the battle of kadesh. ramesses ii dashes into battle (lower row). he is depicted larger than his men, and the enemy, mostly dead and wounded, lie in heaps on the ground. the fortress of kadesh, surrounded by a moat, divides a group of the enemy from the battlefield. these men, far from preparing themselves for battle, are lending a hand to their drowning companions. though this mural has been considered by some as a pretentious interpretation, there is no doubt that the complexity of the composition shows development and sophistication. the individual figures, however, indicate marked deterioration from the expressive detail of the murals of seti i\\'s mortuary temple. egypt has a long history and its own traditions. this again highlights awad bringing social issues into the limelight while also reinforcing that egypt must return to its roots to move ahead. on mohamed mahmoud street is an extensive image of mural paintings inspired by ancient egyptian history, painted by awad in 2012. \"the myth of human destruction in ancient egypt\" with hieroglyphic written by amir fouad. in fact, however, history as cultural and social memory could not be more alive in the egyptian revolution and its aftermath. the egyptian revolution has reinvigorated history on the street in a way that has the capacity to produce change in society. the most intangible evidence of this is in the street murals of mohammad mahmoud street, which incorporated egyptian art in a way that endows both ancient and modern history with positive meanings. this image was expanded upon by awad by painting a series of hostesses, or \"ladies-in-waiting,\" which was meant to \"portray a centuries\" old feminine wisdom with a welcoming smile. this image shows the kindness of the hostess, representing the people, juxtaposed. the position of this figures inspire by the position of the figures unfinished in tomb of ramose. all night it is morning by andy young, november 2014 soft force: women in egypt\\'s islamic awakening by ellen anne mclarney

association (ibga) (in japanese) was established in 1998 as a disabled sports entity to organize, acknowledge and support international blind golf (visually impaired and blind golf) tournaments. as of 2014, it has around 500 registered golfers. in 1996, haruhisa handa who was the founder of japanese blind golf association appealed to blind golf associations around the world to set up a governing organization. in 1997, the world blind golfers conference was held in perth, australia, where representatives from six countries participated to propose the articles of association and handicap system. in 1998, the proposal was resolved at a meeting held during the 5th blind golf world championship in florida, us, so that a global governing organization could be established. handa was elected as the first president, and david blyth from australia became the first chairman (responsible in administration). there were eight organizations that took part in the world blind golfers’ conference held in 1997 from 6 countries; japan, united states, canada, australia, ireland, england, scotland and northern ireland. as of 2014, international blind golf association has 18 member organizations from 16 countries including 4 associate organizations from 4 countries. notes \"the hunger strike\" is a second-season episode of the adult swim animated television series the boondocks. it was set to premiere on january 7, 2008, between \"the story of thugnificent\" and \"attack of the killer kung-fu wolf bitch\", but did not air in the united states until may 29, 2020. in canada, the episode was aired on march 16, 2008, on the network teletoon at night, with a disclaimer stating that \"the views in this program do not reflect that of teletoon canada or its parent companies\". the episode also aired globally elsewhere, and appeared on netflix streaming in canada, as well as on hbo max in the united states shortly before its tv premiere. according to aaron mcgruder on an introduction video for the episode found on the dvd set, this episode was originally set to be titled \"bet sucks\". at the headquarters of bet, fictional president debra leevil (a parody of bet holdings ceo debra l. lee with a personality resembling dr. evil from the austin powers films) presides over a board meeting to discuss the network\\'s strategy for destroying black people. the issue of huey freeman is brought up, as he is shown on cnn giving a press conference stating that he is on a hunger strike and that he will not eat until there is a public apology for creating bet, the network is shut down, and all the executive board members commit seppuku. huey joins forces with the charismatic rev. rollo goodlove (voiced by rapper/singer cee-lo), who adds a flashy image to the fight against bet by lobbying for a boycott of the network. huey initially believes this to be a good idea, as a concert organized by goodlove (and featuring his band) draws widespread attention and sparks a widespread boycott. however, huey gradually discovers that goodlove is primarily interested in drawing media attention to himself through shameless merchandising, self-promotion, and outrageous behavior. goodlove justifies his tactics by explaining that in order to reach the black community, he has to present its members with something they can relate to. leevil and the bet board eventually see a news broadcast in which uncle ruckus expresses his support of bet and its ability to ruin the minds of young black people. taking inspiration from his words, they offer goodlove a sitcom on the network; he accepts, betraying huey and causing the boycott to fall apart. huey ends his hunger strike and asks his grandfather robert, \"what do you do when you can\\'t do nothing, but there\\'s nothing you can do?\" \"you do what you can,\" robert says. there have been rumors that this and a second episode (\"the uncle ruckus reality show\") were initially banned from airing in the u.s. due to threatened litigation from bet. the episodes are said to specifically attack reggie hudlin, bet\\'s president of entertainment from 2005 to 2008, and debra l. lee, president and chief executive officer of bet holdings (parent company of bet). lee is portrayed as deborah leevil, a parody of the character dr. evil from the austin powers movies, and hudlin is portrayed as wedgie rudlin, a \"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his ivy league education.\" however, a cartoon network representative stated that bet had not contacted cartoon network regarding the episodes. sony pictures television, which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter. ironically, hudlin was credited as an executive producer for the first two seasons of the boondocks, though this was only a contractual obligation; hudlin had no involvement with the show since the first pilot was rejected by fox. during the episode, the character deborah leevil relates the mission of bet within the boondocks universe, stating: our leader bob johnson had a dream, a dream creating a network that would accomplish what hundreds of years of slavery, jim crow and malt liquor couldn\\'t – the destruction of black people! on the dvd release of the second season, mcgruder states \"i was looking for changes and improvements, and i didn\\'t see any.\" referring to bet\\'s programming. he decided to show his frustration using satire in the boondocks, reasoning \"i didn\\'t see them. so i said, ok, it\\'s fair game.\" bongoulou is a village in the bassar prefecture in

problem of natural language processing, which concerns the automatic identification of the senses of a word (i.e. meanings). given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of word-sense disambiguation (wsd), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the ambiguity of words in context. the output of a word-sense induction algorithm is a clustering of contexts in which the target word occurs or a clustering of words related to the target word. three main methods have been proposed in the literature: the underlying hypothesis of this approach is that, words are semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, with in similar context windows, or in similar syntactic contexts. each occurrence of a target word in a corpus is represented as a context vector. these context vectors can be either first-order vectors, which directly represent the context at hand, or second-order vectors, i.e., the contexts of the target word are similar if their words tend to co-occur together. the vectors are then clustered into groups, each identifying a sense of the target word. a well-known approach to context clustering is the context-group discrimination algorithm based on large matrix computation methods. word clustering is a different approach to the induction of word senses. it consists of clustering words, which are semantically similar and can thus bear a specific meaning. lin’s algorithm is a prototypical example of word clustering, which is based on syntactic dependency statistics, which occur in a corpus to produce sets of words for each discovered sense of a target word. the clustering by committee (cbc) also uses syntactic contexts, but exploits a similarity matrix to encode the similarities between words and relies on the notion of committees to output different senses of the word of interest. these approaches are hard to obtain on a large scale for many domain and languages. the main hypothesis of co-occurrence graphs assumes that the semantics of a word can be represented by means of a co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. these approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical or collocational relations. hyperlex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters. to deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely curvature clustering, squares, triangles and diamonds (squat++), and balanced maximum spanning tree clustering (b-mst). the patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. a randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices is chinese whispers. by applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks. laguna\\'s 1st congressional district is one of the six congressional districts of the philippines in the province

motori endotermici, is an italian agricultural machinery manufacturer. the company was founded in 1942 in treviglio (bergamo), italy, by the brothers francesco and eugenio cassani. same main products are tractors and front loaders. the company is now part of the sdf group. in 1927, the brothers francesco and eugenio cassani designed and built the cassani 40cv agricultural tractor. this was powered by a diesel engine, a form of propulsion that had begun to be used in industrial, military and rail vehicle applications since the 1920s. the engine was a two stroke horizontal two-cylinder unit with a capacity of 12,723 cm3 producing forty horsepower at 550 rpm, with wick ignition, a compressed air starter system with pressurised air tank air, 4 speeds (3 fwd and 1 rev) and a top speed of 15 km/h. this tractor was sold at a price of 28,000 lire. the tractor designed by cassani was sold under license by officine gaetano barbieri in castelmaggiore. established in 1942, the newly formed company same initially manufactured petrol and diesel engines for civil and industrial applications such as winches, cranes, ploughs and fire-fighting pumps. in 1946, same introduced its first motor mower models, powered by an 8 hp petrol engine. at the milan trade fair in 1946, same presented its first 3-wheeled petrol-powered motor mower, which could also be attached to other agricultural machinery and implements. this was the company\\'s first “universal tractor”, catering for the needs of the market in the years immediately following the second world war. the same 3r/10, a universal small tractor powered by a single cylinder 10 hp petrol engine, was presented in 1948. this machine had two driving wheels and a single steering wheel, variable track and reversible drive. the tractor was awarded the gold medal by the turin agricultural academy. on 24 october 1948, the “giornale dell’agricoltura” described it as “a gem of italian industry”. production of the brand\\'s petrol powered models began in 1950, with the introduction of the 10 hp same 4r/10 and the 20 hp 4r/20. 1952 saw the launch of the da 25, the first mass-produced modern tractor with all-wheel drive, powered by a 25 hp, 2280 cm3 two cylinder diesel engine, with a 7 speed transmission and a top speed of 24.3 km/h. the name da stood for diesel aria (diesel air), as the engine was air-cooled, in keeping with same traditions. mass production of four-wheel drive tractors, with original dual traction system, already conceived in 1928, begins. the new da 30 dt was launched in 1957. offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the da 25. during this period, same also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and reversible ploughs), spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper trailers, irrigation pumps and auger drills. the first da 30 dt models were painted orange with green wheels, while towards the end of the 1950s. the colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine. the same 240 was launched in 1958. this was known as the \\'intelligent tractor\\', as it was equipped as standard with the innovative s.a.c. (\\'stazione automatica di controllo\\' - \\'automatic control station\\') lower hitch arm draft control system conceived by same, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years. this tractor was powered by a 42 hp two cylinder unit, with 6 forward speeds, one reverse speed and a top speed of 28.9 km/h. 1961 was the year of the same puledro and the samecar, a tractor which, after working the land, could then also be used to transport produce in its load bay. a new range of 6 and 8 cylinder engines was also developed during this period. at the verona expo in 1965, same presented its new v engines and the italia v, atlanta, sametto v and 450 v tractors. another major development was the change from traditional rounded cowls to a more modern, boxy design. the centauro range, consisting of three different models, was launched in 1965. these tractors were powered by a 3500 cm3 v4 engine producing 55 hp, with 8 forward speeds, 4 reverse speeds and a top speed of 34.8 km/h. the 1972 corsaro 70 and saturno 80 tractors were presented in 1972. in 1973, same bought lamborghini trattori s.p.a. from ferruccio lamborghini, in its own range. in 1979, same acquired the swiss hürlimann traktoren brand and changed its name to gruppo slh (same+lamborghini+hürlimann), becoming the second largest tractor producer in italy and a leading manufacturer on a global scale. the same explorer family, which was to become one of the most successful product ranges in the history of the company, was launched in 1983. this was the first italian-built tractor with a top speed of 40 km/h, and the only tractor with 4-wheel braking. the technology offered by gruppo slh at the end of the 1980s also included the original twin vision video camera rear view system. same engine technology also took a major step forward, with electronically controlled fuel injection available for the entire 1000 series. in 1991, the electronic powershift transmission, designed specifically for high power applications, was launched together with the titan range, while the frutteto ii introduced a family of tractors dedicated for use in fruit orchards and vineyards. in 1995, gruppo slh acquired the agricultural machinery division of klöckner-humboldt-deutz, giving rise to the same deutz-fahr group. in 1999, same introduced the galileo self-levelling system in the rubin 200 tractor range. this system, developed to facilitate working on gradients, won the golden tractor for design millennium edition award in 2000. 2007 marked the 80th anniversary of the first tractor built by francesco and eugenio - the cassani 40cv. on 12 october 2012, same celebrated its 70th birthday at its historical headquarters in treviglio. to mark the occasion, the italian brand announced a spate of new investments and new models for the future, chief among which the \"virtus\" (100-110-120-130 hp) tractor family, designed by italdesign giugiaro. cassani: same: same tractors: numerous 1:32 and

earlier faces of death which included fake deaths and reenactments, traces consists mostly of actual footage depicting death and injury, and consists also of public domain footage from other films. it was written and narrated by damon fox. since its release, traces of death has been followed by four sequels. the first sequel, traces of death ii, was released in june 1994. this was followed by traces of death iii in december 1994, traces of death iv: resurrected in 1996 and traces of death v: back in action in april 2000. in the first two films of the series, damon fox was the narrator. darrin ramage, who would later become the founder of brain damage films, would become the host for the third, fourth and fifth volumes. unlike faces of death, the footage throughout the entire films are real and are not staged or reenacted. starting with traces of death ii, scenes were accompanied by background music from death metal and grindcore bands. also contained in the series, especially in the first one, is footage of step-by-step autopsy procedures, which are shown from a coroner\\'s point of view. most of the other footage is recognizably notable. among the footage samples seen on traces of death and in the sequels that followed are listed below. the first film of the series also contains allegedly staged footage from savage man savage beast, where a tourist, pit dernitz supposedly gets mauled and eaten by african lions. other scenes that feature animals include undated footage of a pig experiment by military scientists at the burn center in fort sam houston (derived from a 1987 mondo film entitled true gore), an animal control officer, florence crowell being attacked by a pit bull in los angeles, california in 1987, and a black bear getting shocked off a utility pole in albuquerque, new mexico in 1989. the first two films both contain scenes of sex reassignment surgery, which is featured in the 1974 mondo film shocking asia. some autopsy footages were taken from the 1961 u.s. army training film basic autopsy procedure. also included is an interview with james vance, who had attempted suicide with a shotgun at a church playground in sparks, nevada (taken from the documentary dream deceivers). the only known footage showing evidence of ilse koch is included as well. there is one unusual piece of footage taken at a monster truck show in baltimore, maryland, on march 23, 1992. what makes this footage so unusual is that the robot transformer at the show malfunctioned. a large rod from the malfunctioning robot went into the actor of the alien suit\\'s chest, and exploded. another notable air show crash in the film took place in plainview, texas, on september 11, 1983, where the pilot lost both his plane\\'s wings in mid-air and plummeted into the field below. there are many other various plane crashes and race car crashes during the middle and towards the end of the film. the third edition starts with crime scenes in urban american cities such as new york city, ranging from murders to traffic crashes. these pieces look as if taken from the \\'60s and \\'70s. this volume also shows what it is like to survive an attack, as in a 1991 press conference of frank tempest, an english man disfigured in the face when he was attacked by two pit bulls. also included is graphic content of gang violence in russia, various motocross and amateur race car crashes, and cockfighting held in the philippines. another piece of notable footage in the fourth volume is a moose killing a man in anchorage, alaska on january 9, 1995. towards the start of the film graphic photographs of birth defects are shown. there is also footage of traffic crashes from the graphic driving education film, signal 30. the last volume starts with three police chases. the first was in los angeles in june 1996. the second was also in los angeles, but it took place in june 1995. the third took place in whittier, california in september 1995. all were televised live by helicopter pilot zoey tur. the music clearance were provided by subtempeco muzik (pseudonymously credited as t.o.d.), which derived from various film soundtracks. later in traces of death 3, the first soundtrack album was released on cd.the soundtrack for the first installment were tracks by j.r. bookwalter from the 1989 film robot ninja. the soundtrack for traces of death iii was released on cd by relapse records in 1995. the music featured in the film include: in 2003, a box set of the entire series was released on dvd by brain damage films. the original traces of death has run into controversy worldwide due to its graphic content. in 1997, amy hochberg, a woman living in coaldale, pennsylvania rented the film from a video store and was so disgusted by the film\\'s content that she considered keeping the tape as to avoid children from procuring it from the store. she also contacted multiple animal rights groups after witnessing a scene in the film wherein a pig is experimented on with a blowtorch. she also lodged a complaint with the video store she had rented it from, as she thought the film was simply \"911 calls with a little more\". in 2003, a dvd boxset of the film and its sequels were confiscated by the australian customs and border protection service, after being deemed to \"contravene regulation 4a(1a)(a) of the customs (prohibited imports) regulations.\" in 2005, the british board of film classification refused to give the first film an age certificate, effectively banning it. the bbfc considered the film to have \"no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the images shown\", while also suggesting that the film could potentially breach uk law under the obscene publications act. the hybrid elm cultivar ulmus × hollandica \\'fastigiata\\' was first listed and described as ulmus glabra fastigiata, a narrow-crowned elm with large smooth leaves, by petzold and kirchner in arboretum muscaviense (1864). c. berndt of the berndt nursery, zirlau, schweidnitz, described an elm of the same name in mitteilungen der deutschen dendrologischen gesellschaft (1915, including a photograph), that he had received in 1903 \"from a renowned nursery in holstein\" as ulmus montana fastigiata macrophylla. a tree of that name had been listed by dieck in 1885 without description. berndt reported that his u. glabra fastigiata was \"easy to confuse with u. montana superba\", a tree \"known in the magdeburg region as ulmus praestans\", a statement confirming that, like that cultivar, his tree was a form of u. × hollandica. karl gustav hartwig who received specimens of u. praestans from kiessling of the magdeburg city nursery in 1908, concluded (1912) that u. glabra fastigiata kirchner was indistinguishable in leaf or habit from u. praestans. an u. campestris glabra fastigiata arb. musc. [ = kirchner] was distributed by the hesse nursery, weener, germany, in the 1930s, where it was listed separately from u. praestans. the späth nursery of berlin marketed an u. montana fastigiata glabra in the 1890s and early 1900s. bean (1925) listed an u. glabra \\'fastigiata stricta\\' (1925). not to be confused with exeter elm, loudon\\'s u. montana fastigiata (1838) and elwes and henry\\'s u. montana var. fastigiata (1913). kirchner\\'s ulmus glabra fastigiata was narrow-crowned, with large smoothish leaves of firmer texture than his ulmus glabra mill.. berndt\\'s ulmus glabra fastigiata was a tree of tight narrow pyramidal growth, the leaf being dark, acuminate, irregularly veined, and often wider at the top than lower down. berndt reported the tree as \"less vigorous than ulmus montana superba\" [ = u. praestans]. ulmus glabra fastigiata was cultivated in silesia by the berndt nursery, zirlau, schweidnitz, in the early 20th century. berndt reported that, though stocked in only a few nurseries, it was praised at the 20th century exhibition in breslau. no specimens are known to survive. the trio competition in aerobic gymnastics at the 2001 world games in akita was played from 17 to 18 august. the aerobic gymnastics competition took place at akita city gymnasium. a total of 8 teams entered the competition. only final was held. parornix conspicuella is a moth of the family gracillariidae. it is known from québec, canada, and pennsylvania, maine, michigan and vermont in the united states. the larvae feed on betula nigra. they mine the leaves of their host plant. this article relating to moths in genus parornix is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it. colonel sir david harris kcmg (12 july 1852 - 23 september 1942) was a soldier, diamond magnate, and legislator. he was born in london, england, and emigrated to the colony of natal in 1871. he later traveled 950 km from durban to kimberley where he began working as a prospector. within two years, he was wealthy and had made the acquaintance of cecil rhodes. he joined the du toit\\'s pan horse regiment in 1876 fought in the gaika-galeka war (part of the xhosa wars in the eastern cape. he also fought in other campaigns and distinguished himself in the langeberg rebellion (1896-97). he served in the home guard during the siege of kimberley. in 1897, he joined the parliament of the cape of good hope on the death of barney barnato. he held the seat for 32 years. in 1897, he also became a director of de beers consolidated mines, an office he held until 1931. harris married his wife, rosa gabriel, in 1873, in the first jewish wedding to take place in kimberley. jan hejduk (born 13 february 1947) is a czechoslovak boxer. he competed in the men\\'s middleweight event at the 1968 summer olympics. this biographical article related to a czech boxer is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it. coleochaete is a genus of parenchymatous charophyte green algae in the order coleochaetales. they are haploid, reproduce both sexually and asexually, and have true multicellular organisation, with plasmodesmata communicating between adjacent cells. the plants form flat, sprawling discs on solid surfaces in freshwater streams worldwide, usually as epiphytes on aquatic plants or growing on the surface of stones. they are seen as one of two most probable sister groups to land plant species, the second candidate group being the characeae. the issue is still not resolved. as they show some of the earliest and simplest features of multicellular plant growth, they are ideal model organisms in the field of synthetic biology.[citation needed] they are easy to culture and techniques that have been used to study arabidopsis thaliana are now being applied to coleochaete. coleochaete has a sterile jacket of cells that surround the gametangia and zygotes that are protected by a layer of sterile cells after fertilization. however, unlike land plants, coleochaete has zygotic meiosis, meiosis taking place directly in the zygote and not in diploid cells resulting from mitotic division of the zygote. this green algae-related article is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it.green green grass by the river is a 1992 taiwanese television drama series based on chiung yao\\'s novel of the same name. the series was filmed in yangzhou and nanjing, china. xiao cao is a young orphan living with her cruel aunt and uncle. she has a sisterly bond with her neighbour, qing qing, who is being forced into a marriage with a much older man by her older brother. desperate to escape their unfortunate circumstances, the two girls manage to run away together on the day of qing qing\\'s wedding. during their escape they coincidentally meet he shiwei, a young university student who is also running away from his family due to an arranged marriage. after a few initial misunderstandings the three decide to travel together. however, things become complicated when they encounter the fu family, and the family matriarch mistakes he shiwei for her son, fu yuankai, who died 10 years ago. this article related to taiwanese television is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it.'"

              "'michał antoni łempicki (russian: михаил михайлович лэмпицкий) (1856-1930) was a mining engineer and entrepreneur. he was a polish public and political figure, deputy of the state duma of the russian empire for the piotrków governorate. michał łempicki was born on september 14, 1856, near sztum[verification needed], russian empire (in today\\'s poland). his mother was izabela, his father, michał senior (1818-1895), was a nobleman from the province of płock, then in the congress poland. in 1861, he was sentenced to exile to samara. a year later, his wife isabella was allowed to join him with their three children, michał antoni and his sisters. after a brief release to saint petersburg in 1871, the samara exile resumed till 1886. in 1874, the young michał graduated from the samara gymnasium and moved to saint petersburg. from 1874 to 1881, he studied at the st. petersburg mining institute (russian: санкт-петербургский горный институт): he was graduated both from the institute natural sciences department and from the physics-mathematics faculty of saint petersburg imperial university. from 1881 onwards, he served in the mining department as the head of the polish mining factories transferred from warsaw. in 1884, he conducted geological research in the provinces of kharkiv, yekaterinoslav and kursk, with the civil servant rank of titular advisor (russian: титулярный советник). the next year, he became the acting senior clerk of the salt division of the mining department. as such, michał łempicki carried out several works for the russian empire: in 1890, he joined the polish mining plants section of the mining department: to this end, he left saint petersburg to live in the dąbrowa basin on polish territory. in 1895, he became a member of the main mining directorate (russian: главное горное управление - ггу), offering technical expertise to the mining company \"граф ренард\" (\"count renard\") in sosnowica region; there he eventually took over the management of the society till 1901. in 1896, he founded the company m. łempicki i spółka przedsiębiorstwo górnicze, wiertnicze i hydrologiczne (english: m. łempicki\\'s company of mining, drilling and hydrology), based in sosnowiec, silesia: it operated not only in silesia, but also in the territory of the russian partition and in siberia. the company is still active today under the name g-drilling- united oilfield services. during the same period, michał was an active member of various polish industrial and scientific societies: hence in 1891 he entered the \"physiographic commission of the academy of arts and sciences\", which founders originated from the dąbrowa basin. from 1901 to 1906, he was the managing director of the joint stock company of the strahovitsky mining plants in the radom province. in 1906, łempicki had gathered several positions in the mining business: michał łempicki published a number of papers related to mining exploitation. he retired in 1912 with the administrative civilian rank of state councilor. since 1900, he was the co-owner of a mining and drilling firm m. łempicki and co. in the piotrków governorate: it carried out large-scale drilling operations in poland, ukraine, belarus and lithuania, notably to build artesian wells. the company, which name changed over the years, had after 1905 many shareholders, in particular engineers from the dąbrowa basin (józef předpelsky, anthony olszewski, stanislav sventokhovsky, edward poplavsky). local branches were established in katowice, warsaw and vilnius. łempicki had also invested in several other business, including the korwinów ceramic factory near czestochowa or an agricultural machinery factory in lublin. the amount of his assets is estimated at 500 000 imperial rubles. in november 1905, michał took part in the polish delegation appealing to the prime minister sergei witte. the goal of this petition was to ask for a reconsideration of the policy of the russian government towards the kingdom of poland. he was very active among the polish community of saint petersburg, becoming in march 1906, the secretary of the polish central election committee in the russian capital. as a matter of fact, łempicki was harassed by the russian authorities. indeed in 1907, having failed to be elected to the second state duma, michał was forced to emigrate to switzerland then germany. back to poland, he continued to administer his mining companies. on october 20, 1912, he was elected to the fourth convocation of the state duma, as representative of the piotrków governorate. he then joined the \"koło polskie\" (english: polish wheel-russian: польское коло), a group of polish deputies in the state duma of the russian empire. at the duma, he was a member of the budget commission, the trade and industry commission and the labor commission. on the eve of the first world war, łempicki entered the occupied territory of poland with an austrian passport. according to polish sources, he had renounced citizenship, even though he still signed his articles in the western press as \"deputy of the russian state duma\" (french: \"député a la douma d\\'empire\"). with the help of austria-hungary, he co-created a league of polish sovereignty and became its president. his actions were utterly condemned by the russian duma: on december 12, 1915, he was expelled from the \"koło polskie\" for \"anti-russian activity\". following the occupation of the congress poland by german troops, michał actively cooperated with the ruling administration: as a consequence, on december 15, 1916, he was deprived of his deputy mandate by a decree of the state duma, officially for non-attendance at meetings. from 1917 to 1919, łempicki participated to the \"provisional council of state\" where he collaborated, inter alia, with józef piłsudski, franciszek radziwiłł or władysław studnicki: he chaired the department of the interior, which was responsible for matters related to the organization of local administration, health care and electoral law. since 1917, he was also a member of the military commission established by the provisional council of state. at the restoration of poland\\'s independence, he was appointed permanent consultant to the ministry of industry and trade. in particular, he was engaged in the work organization in mines and metallurgical plants in silesia and in the dąbrowa basin. he took part in the preparation of the draft law on mining and on the status of the state geological institute. furthermore, he actively participated in the foundation of polish military formations. in 1921, łempicki and his wife moved to bydgoszcz, where they found here a large group of former inhabitants of the eastern borderlands. he knew the city after previous stays at a friend\\'s flat at 23 chrobrego street. they lived in the newly built villa at 6 chopina street. in bydgoszcz, michał kept contact with warsaw institutions, where he liked to visit the sejm and enter into political discussions with various ministries, having still many friends in this domain. additionally, he often met with colleagues from the society of industrialists and was still a shareholder of many companies. he started to write articles for the daily local journal \"dziennik bydgoski\". in the 1920s, he was politically associated with the national democratic movement. in his villa, he had gathered a rich library, ornamented with many pictures (mainly portraits of children) by his deceased sister leokadia łempicka (1865–1913). he shared his passion of books with a good friend of his, dr. władysław bełza. even before world war i, łempicki started to cooperate with newspapers, like the kurier warszawski. he co-founded in 1903 the \"przegląd górniczo-hutniczy\", a journal related to questions about mining and metallurgical industry. in bydgoszcz, he pursued his writings (mainly political and social-oriented) for the \"dziennik bydgoski\". he died on december 29, 1930, at the age of 74. his funeral took place on january 1, 1931: according to his will, there were neither speeches nor wreathes over the grave. its coffin was placed in the \"missionary fathers church\" in ossoliński avenue. he was buried in the \"nowofarny cemetery\" in bydgoszcz. michał łempicki bequeathed all his collections, about 800 volumes and the correspondence of his father michał, to the city of bydgoszcz. the donation comprised books, paintings, letters that his father once received from friends, autographs of archbishop zygmunt feliński, poet karol baliński, historian tadeusz korzon, mikhail bakunin and writer eliza orzeszkowa. in january 1928, on łempicki\\'s initiative, the \"łempicki family association\" was established. it aimed at providing moral and material support, granting scholarships to young people in education and creating institutions of family and social benefit. łempicki wanted also this institution to establish sheltering houses in mazovia and in white and red ruthenia. during their life, the couple made regular donations to the kuchnia kresowa, an association run by poles from the eastern borderlands and providing food for people in the need. likewise, they supported local orphanage, the polish red cross or the charity actions conducted by the \"dziennik bydgoski\". michał łempicki was one of the contributors to the construction in bydgoszcz of the first monument to henryk sienkiewicz elevated in poland. the original statue from 1927 and funded via a local committee composed led by witold bełza, was razed down in september 1939. the current monument was made by horno-popławski in 1968, is located on the very site of its predecessor, in today\\'s jan kochanowski park. his wife was józefa née biedrzyńska (russian: йозефина урождённая бичинская) from korwin: they got married on july 23, 1889, in kielce. she had an artistic penchant at her death, józefina bequeathed the collections of 48 paintings by leokadia, michał\\'s sister: they are now part of the collections of the regional museum in bydgoszcz. the łempicki family had no children. his father michał senior was sentenced two times by the tsarist regime, as an opposent to the alexander ii of russia influenced by the anarchist theories of mikhail bakunin: michał łempicki had several siblings: while living as a citizen of the russian empire, michał łempicki received two decorations: in january, 2008 the bbc reported that simba makoni might be nominated to run against robert mugabe in the zimbabwean 2008 presidential election. on 5 february 2008 simba makoni held a press conference in harare where he stated that he was challenging robert mugabe to become the next president of zimbabwe. up to that point he had remained a member of the zanu-pf politburo and the party\\'s deputy secretary of economic affairs. he told reporters, flanked by ibbo mandaza and retired major kudzai mbudzi: \"following very extensive and intensive consultations with party members and activists countrywide, and also with others outside the party, i have accepted the call and hereby advise the people of zimbabwe that i offer myself as candidate for the office of president...i share the agony and anguish of all citizens over the extreme hardships that we all have endured for nearly 10 years now...i also share the widely held view that these hardships are a result of failure of national leadership and that change at that level is a pre-requisite for change at other levels of national endeavour.\"makoni said that he would have liked to run as zanu-pf\\'s candidate, but since he could not, he was running as an independent. he later said that his conclusion that political change was necessary was not the result of a \"st.-paul-on-the-road-to-damascus awakening. this has been a continuum, incremental, things have been building up.\" running under the slogan \"let\\'s get zimbabwe working again\", makoni\\'s theme was dawn, and this name was given to the organisation supporting his campaign, mavambo/kusile/dawn. he adopted the yellow as his campaign colour. the colour represents gold and the wealth of zimbabwe, reinforcing his focus on solutions to the current economic crisis. the colour also represents the rising sun and the dawn of a new zimbabwe, anchored in the hopes and aspirations of zimbabweans for a brighter future. his campaign logo appeared very similar to that of united states presidential candidate barack obama\\'s. joseph chinotimba, a notorious war veteran who led the violent invasions of white owned farms in 2000, threatened makoni with violence following the announcement of his candidature. a leading figure in zanu-pf, emmerson mnangagwa, told zbc tv that by choosing to stand for a position when the party had already chosen someone to stand for that position, makoni had expelled himself from the party. the herald newspaper denounced makoni as being a pawn of the united kingdom whose candidacy was being used in hopes of splitting the zanu-pf vote so that morgan tsvangirai of the movement for democratic change (mdc) could win the election. speaking on 7 february, makoni denied claims that he was a western pawn or that he was being used by zanu-pf itself to split the opposition vote. he also said that the zanu-pf constitution did not provide for self-expulsion and that still considered himself a member of zanu-pf until and unless he is expelled from the party through due process. referring to support he claims to have inside zanu-pf, he urged these supporters to \"remain steadfast and not be intimidated\". zanu-pf spokesman nathan shamuyarira subsequently sought to clarify the matter by saying that makoni was expelled from the party, in accordance with party rules providing for the expulsion of a member who challenges a designated zanu-pf candidate in an election, and he said that anyone who supported makoni would be expelled as well. morgan tsvangirai said on 11 february that makoni was merely \"old wine in a new bottle\" and that he would not ally with makoni for the election. mugabe spoke about makoni\\'s candidacy for the first time on 21 february, describing it as \"absolutely disgraceful\", comparing makoni to a prostitute, and criticizing makoni for what he considered a self-important attitude. on 15 february, arthur mutambara, the leader of another mdc faction not led by tsvangirai, said that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back makoni. at the opening of makoni\\'s campaign on 29 february, former interior minister dumiso dabengwa and former speaker of parliament cyril ndebele were present to support him. also present at white city hall where makoni launched his campaign was edgar tekere who vowed to de-campaign mugabe until election time. simba makoni received 8.3% of the vote in the first round. war is an intense armed conflict[a] between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. it is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. while some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances. the english word war derives from the 11th-century old english words wyrre and werre, from old french werre (also guerre as in modern french), in turn from the frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the proto-germanic *werzō \\'mixture, confusion\\'. the word is related to the old saxon werran, old high german werran, and the german verwirren, meaning \"to confuse\", \"to perplex\", and \"to bring into confusion\". the earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a mesolithic cemetery in jebel sahaba, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. about forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death. since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe. the advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. according to conway w. henderson, \"one source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 bc and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (beer 1981: 20).\" an unfavorable review of this estimate mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: \"in addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed \\'approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war\\' to \\'approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&c.\\'\" the lower figure is more plausible, but could still be on the high side considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 bc and 2002 ad (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total. primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1% of deaths and claimed 400 million victims. added to the aforementioned figure of 1,240 million between 3500 bc and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. for comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century. in war before civilization, lawrence h. keeley, a professor at the university of illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly. keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. all of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids. william rubinstein wrote \"pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...\\'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the europeans].\\'\" in western europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place. during the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the political left as a force to be reckoned with. in 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, albert einstein famously stated, \"i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought, but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones.\" mao zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the united states since, even if \"half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.\" a distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies. the major exceptions were the korean war, the indo-pakistani war of 1971, the iran–iraq war, the gulf war, the eritrean–ethiopian war, and the russo-ukrainian war. the human security report 2005 documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the cold war in the early 1990s. however, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the center for international development and conflict management\\'s \"peace and conflict\" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled. entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. war aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve. fried defines war aims as \"the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war\". tangible/intangible aims: explicit/implicit aims: positive/negative aims: war aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into \"peace conditions\" – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war. throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. however, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. while conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. for instance, the thirty years\\' war (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as world war i, although it was higher during world war ii (wwii). that said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since wwii has been unusually peaceful. the deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is world war ii, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the mongol conquests at up to 60 million. as concerns a belligerent\\'s losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the paraguayan war (see paraguayan war casualties). in 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. in 2003, richard smalley identified war as the sixth biggest problem (of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years. war usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. for instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the byelorussian ssr in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers. three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. these are the two world wars, followed by the second sino-japanese war (which is sometimes considered part of world war ii, or as overlapping). most of the others involved china or neighboring peoples. the death toll of world war ii, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls. military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, and death. in every war in which american soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.swank and marchand\\'s world war ii study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders. one-tenth of mobilised american men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white american males aged 13 to 43 died in the american civil war, including about 6% in the north and approximately 18% in the south. the war remains the deadliest conflict in american history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. united states military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. of the 60 million european military personnel who were mobilized in world war i, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. during napoleon\\'s retreat from moscow, more french military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the russians. of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the neman on 25 june 1812, less than 40,000 returned. more military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. in addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. for instance, during the seven years\\' war, the royal navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were \\'missing\\'. it is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war. most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine, disease, and death in the civilian population). during the thirty years\\' war in europe, the population of the holy roman empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. war also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. a medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking water. most estimates of world war ii casualties indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of whom were civilians. deaths in the soviet union were around 27 million. since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar soviet union was much lower than it otherwise would have been. once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. in certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. for example, the territory of alsace-lorraine has been traded between france and germany on three different occasions. typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. some economists[who?] believe war can stimulate a country\\'s economy (high government spending for world war ii is often credited with bringing the u.s. out of the great depression by most keynesian economists), but in many cases, such as the wars of louis xiv, the franco-prussian war, and world war i, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. for example, russia\\'s involvement in world war i took such a toll on the russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the russian revolution of 1917. world war ii was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion u.s. dollars on the war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices). the great depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials. by the end of the war, 70% of european industrial infrastructure was destroyed. property damage in the soviet union inflicted by the axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. the combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries. there are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common. carl von clausewitz said, \\'every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.\\' dutch psychoanalyst joost meerloo held that, \"war is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.\" other psychoanalysts such as e.f.m. durban and john bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent. this aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies. by this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. the italian psychoanalyst franco fornari, a follower of melanie klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective \"elaboration\" of mourning. fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \"love need\": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. for the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation. despite fornari\\'s theory that man\\'s altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. one psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by maurice walsh. he argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. war is caused by leaders who seek war such as napoleon and hitler. such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war. naturally, the common people don\\'t want war; neither in russia nor in england nor in america, nor for that matter in germany. that is understood. but, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. that is easy. all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. it works the same way in any country.several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. there are two main schools: one sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition. the latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states. psychologist and linguist steven pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. [failed verification] he also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group\\'s (or an individual\\'s) reputation (\"honor\").[citation needed] crofoot and wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which \"coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups\", is a characteristic of most human societies. those in which it has been lacking \"tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors\". ashley montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. montagu\\'s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the chewong and semai of the malay peninsula. bobbi s. low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive. war can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. in this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. war has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity. while this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. there are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including presidents of the united states and u.s. generals, expressed support for an economic view of war. the marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism. marxist economists karl kautsky, rosa luxemburg, rudolf hilferding and vladimir lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand. since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism. demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, malthusian and youth bulge theories: malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict. pope urban ii in 1095, on the eve of the first crusade, advocating crusade as a solution to european overpopulation, said: for this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. enter upon the road to the holy sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. this is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. thomas malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine. the violent herder–farmer conflicts in nigeria, mali, sudan and other countries in the sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth. according to heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the \"fighting age\" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. it will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay. heinsohn saw both past \"christianist\" european colonialism and imperialism, as well as today\\'s islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern europe, including the french revolution of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest german youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of nazism in germany in the 1930s. the 1994 rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge. youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the world bank, population action international, and the berlin institute for population and development. youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination. geoffrey parker argues that what distinguishes the \"western way of war\" based in western europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: the western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and—from about 1500 onward—a unique system of war finance. the combination of all five provided a formula for military success....the outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline. parker argues that western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, \"the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they\\'re attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.\" discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small \"artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency. rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. rationalism (and neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. in \"rationalist explanations for war\", james fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war: \"issue indivisibility\" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other. \"information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent\" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state\\'s victory or loss. for instance, geoffrey blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. he cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, \"war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.\" thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states\\' inability to make credible commitments. within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias, but are still \"as rational as you and me\". according to philosopher iain king, \"most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....\" king asserts that \"most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink\" which is faulty, but still rational. the rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. the iraq war proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars. the statistical analysis of war was pioneered by lewis fry richardson following world war i. more recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the correlates of war project, peter brecke and the uppsala conflict data program.[citation needed] the following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. this kind of division was first proposed by kenneth waltz in man, the state, and war and has been often used by political scientists since then. : 143 there are several different international relations theory schools. supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma. : 145 within the realist school as represented by scholars such as henry kissinger and hans morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as kenneth waltz and john mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are: the two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance. : 148 liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. realists[who?] respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. : 149 furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. : 150 empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don\\'t necessarily trade less with each other. : 150 these theories suggest differences in people\\'s personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. : 157 for instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases, : 157 such as prospect theory. the morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years. the two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello. jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. there are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used. jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. the two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. the principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent. the just war theory was foundational in the creation of the united nations and in international law\\'s regulations on legitimate war. fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as pragmatism, racism, and social darwinism, hold that violence is good. pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. social darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. these are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the means. lewis coser, u.s. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society. religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the second vatican council document gaudiem et spes: \"any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against god and man himself. it merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.\" anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, world war i, world war ii, and the vietnam war. in the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the united states invasion of afghanistan and iraq. protests opposing the war in afghanistan occurred in europe, asia, and the united states. during a war, brief pauses of violence may be called for, and further agreed to— ceasefire, temporary cessation, humanitarian pauses and corridors, days of tranquility, de-confliction arrangements. there a number of disadvantages, obstacles and hesitations against implementing such pauses such as a humanitarian corridor. pauses in conflict are also ill-advised; reasons such as \"delay of defeat\" and the \"weakening of credibility\". natural causes for a pause may include events such as the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. brian fleming (born october 8, 1971) is an american professional wrestler. he is best known by his ring name al katrazz, a word play on the name of alcatraz prison and a reference fleming\\'s gimmick of a convict. after

it.the jose b. lingad memorial general hospital is located in san fernando, pampanga, philippines. it is a level iii tertiary, training and teaching hospital with 250 authorized beds as mandated by republic act (r.a.) 6780 enacted in 1990. the hospital caters to the people of region iii, with the people of pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of bataan, nueva ecija, bulacan, tarlac, zambales and aurora as its secondary catchment areas. in the nearly 100 years of existence of the jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital, enormous development had been done in terms of facility improvement, manpower complement and capability enhancement. indeed, the hospital had come a long way. from its beginning in 1921 from the two (2) hectare lot at dolores, san fernando, pampanga donated by the late juan teopaco, it is now regarded as one of the leading referral center in the region. the jblmrh started at an eight (8) bed capacity hospital formerly known as pampanga provincial hospital. it was financed and operated by provincial health funds under the management of six pioneering individuals headed by dr. lorenzo de jesus. to satisfy the growing hospital need of the people, various material improvements were introduced in the hospital, thus increasing its bed capacity from eight (8) beds to fifty (50) beds in january 1951. later in july 1964, the hospital\\'s name changed into central luzon general hospital with the corresponding increase in its bed capacity to one hundred twenty five (125) beds. dr. bartolome vecta was appointed as chief of hospital during this time. further construction of various facilities in the hospital led to the increase in its bed capacity to one hundred fifty (150) in 1972 and again to two hundred beds (200) in 1975. in 1979, dr. vecta was replaced by dr. ignacio valencia. during the incumbency of dr. valencia, a building that can accommodate one hundred beds was constructed, thus finally increasing the hospital\\'s bed capacity into two hundred fifty (250) beds. dr. conrado mariano took the helm of managing the hospital after dr. ignacio valencia. in march 1988, dr. mariano was promoted to assistant regional director at the regional health office no. 3, hence he was replaced by the then provincial health officer of bataan in the person of dr. rogelio reyes. dr. reyes served the hospital for three years until finally in february 1991 he retired to give way to his political ambition. on november 25, 1989, ra no. 6780 entitled “an act of changing the name of the central luzon general hospital located in the municipality of san fernando, province of pampanga, to jose b. lingad memorial general hospital” was one of the bills signed by the then former president corazon c. aquino. it is on this day on that the hospital was recognized as jose b. lingad memorial general hospital. dra. venus galang, the then chief of medical professional staff was appointed as officer-in-charge in march 1991 to fill-in the position left by dr. reyes. during the term of dra. galang, the hospital was being awarded for being a baby friendly hospital. in december 1992, dr. ladislao yuchongco was appointed as permanent chief of hospital of jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital. in his term, he was able to accomplish the accreditation of the anesthesia department. in 1994, dr. ladislao yuchongco was reassigned at the national mental health hospital. from this period until may 1998 the following doctors became officers-in-charge : dr. ricardo t. trinidad - january 1992 to december 1997 dr. emilio cadayona - july 4, to march 21, 1995, dr. manuel ponce - march 22 to january 24, 1996, dra venus galang - february 1, 1996 to march 5, 1996, on january 20, 1997, until march 25, 1997, dr. ladislao yuchongco resumed his post as chief of hospital of jblmrh until he was reassigned to doh-central office. from march 26, 1997, until may 17, 1998, dr. ricardo b. gonzales, dra. cecilia paulino and dra. ethelyn nieto successively became officers-in-charge of the hospital. on may 18, 1998, dr. venancio s. banzon from the provincial health office of bulacan was appointed chief of hospital. dr. banzon is until the present time occupies the said position. the jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital is a level iii tertiary, teaching and training hospital with 250 authorized beds as mandated by r.a. 6780 year 1990. the hospital caters to the people of region iii with the people of pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of bataan, nueva ecija, bulacan, tarlac, zambales and aurora as its secondary catchment areas. in 2012, republic act no. 10355, “an act increasing the bed capacity of jose b. lingad memorial general hospital in san fernando city, pampanga from two hundred fifty (250) to five hundred (500). upgrading its services and facilities and professional health care, authorizing the increase of its medical personnel and appropriating funds therefore” was signed by president benigno simeon c. aquino. jose b. lingad memorial regional hospital shall continue its quality improvement program based on the standards of iso

seventh year at illinois, harry combes continued to offer the fans of the fighting illini a successful team that they could be follow across the country to record crowds. the 1953-54 team returned one of the most dominate players in the ncaa, johnny \"red\" kerr. during the season, kerr shattered illinois’ single-season scoring record by tallying 556 points in his senior year. kerr’s 1,299 career points in three seasons currently ranks 20th on the all-time illinois scoring list. after his illinois career came to an end, kerr started a 12-year professional career followed by becoming the first head coach of the chicago bulls in 1966. the 1954 team added twin brothers, paul and phil judson from hebron, illinois, bruce brothers and bill ridley as sophomores. a youth movement that helped the illini finish in a 3rd place tie in the big ten. unfortunately the illini would lose 5 total games with three of the five losses coming at the hands of ranked opponents. the starting lineup included captain john kerr at the center position, jim wright and paul judson at guard and bruce brothers and max hooper at the forward slots. all-time illini roster source source bold italic connotes conference game hl7 aecg (the hl7 annotated electrocardiogram) is a standard medical record data format for storing and retrieving electrocardiogram data for a patient. like other hl7 formats, it is xml based. the hl7 aecg standard was created in response to the food and drug administration’s digital electrocardiogram initiative which was introduced november, 2001. the fda initiative required ecg waveforms and annotations submitted to the fda to have a standard format for the data. at the time, no current ecg waveform standards met all the fda\\'s needs. as a result, the fda, sponsors, core laboratories, and device manufactures worked together within hl7 to create a standard to meet the fda requirements. the aecg standard was created by hl7\\'s regulated clinical research information

tree of the family myrtaceae native to new south wales and queensland in australia, which can reach 60 metres (200 feet) in height. it generally grows on heavier soils. the cream flowers appear in spring and are fused into compound flowerheads. english botanist james edward smith first described the turpentine as metrosideros glomulifera in 1797, from a collection in the sydney district. it was given its current binomial name by german botanist franz josef niedenzu in 1893. common names include turpentine, luster, red turpentine or red luster. it was formerly known as syncarpia laurifolia ten. two subspecies are recognised, the widespread nominate, and subspecies glabra which is found from bulahdelah north to kempsey and has smooth leaf undersurfaces. in a suitable location, the turpentine grows into a large straight-trunked tree up to 45 or even 55 m (150–180 ft) high with a dbh of up to 1.3 or even 1.5 m (4–5 ft). on poorer soils it grows as a small tree or even adopts a mallee habit. the thick brown bark is fibrous, with deep vertical furrows running down the trunk. the leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and pairs grow close together so that they resemble a whorled group of four leaves. on 0.7–1.3 cm long petioles, the thick leaves are ovate to ellipictal and measure 7–10 cm (3–4 in) long and 2.5–4.5 cm (1–2 in) across with recurved margins. their upper surface is a dull dark green, and lower surface much paler, either covered by fine hairs in subspecies glomulifera or smooth in glabra. flowering takes place from august to december, peaking in september. the cream flowers are fused in groups of seven into compound flowerheads. this is followed by the development of the compound fruit – 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) diameter woody capsules which ripen in summer. the turpentine is found in eastern queensland and new south wales, from atherton in the far north to as far south as murramarang national park. north of gympie, the distribution is fragmented, with colonies on the blackdown and consuelo tablelands, tinaroo district and windsor tableland. the habitat most commonly associated with the turpentine is transitional forest between rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. here it grows as an emergent tree, and is associated with such trees as flooded gum (eucalyptus grandis), tallowwood (e. microcorys), grey ironbark (e. paniculata), white stringybark (e. globoidea), yellow stringybark (e. muelleriana), white-topped box (e. quadrangulata), rough-barked apple (angophora floribunda), brush box (lophostemon confertus) and various rainforest species. it also grows with spotted gum (corymbia maculata) and blackbutt (e. pilularis). on poorer soils, it can grow much smaller in dry sclerophyll forest in association with smooth-barked apple (angophora costata) and yellow bloodwood (corymbia eximia). adaptable to a wide range of soils, the turpentine is most suited to moderate to high-nutrient soils, such as clay soil over wianamatta shale in the sydney region. valleys and flat areas are highly suitable sites. in the sydney region, the species reaches an altitude of 300 m (980 ft), but this extends to 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level in northern queensland. the turpentine is one of the dominant species of the critically endangered sydney turpentine-ironbark forest ecological community. the largest known turpentine, located near the williams river recreation reserve in the barrington tops national park, new south wales, measures 7.90 m (26 ft) trunk circumference at breast height, 58 m (190 ft) tall, 20 m (66 ft) crown spread width and \"points 517\" (points calculated using the national register of big trees formula). the flowers are pollinated by native bees and european honeybees, and possibly flies and moths. the grey-headed flying fox (pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (p. scapulatus) also pollinate the flowers. the rainbow lorikeet (trichoglossus haematodus) and noisy miner (manorina melanocephala) forage for nectar. the turpentine regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber and epicormic buds. turpentine trees are thought to live up to 500 years. highly durable, turpentine timber is used in heavy-traffic flooring, for poles and wharves. it resists marine invertebrates and termites, and is one of the most difficult timbers to ignite. a hardy and adaptable tree, turpentine tolerates heavy soils and frosts, and is suitable for large gardens and parks, where it provides good shade with its dense canopy. benedetti–wehrli stadium is a stadium in naperville, illinois. it is primarily used for american football, soccer and track and field and has a seating capacity of 5,500. benedetti–wehrli stadium is named after two north central college

girl orphans who were sent from portugal to overseas colonies during the portuguese empire as part of portugal\\'s colonization efforts. the orphans were married to native rulers or portuguese settlers. orfãs do rei translates to \"orphans of the king\", and they were all girls. their fathers were portuguese men who died in battle for the king. they were sent to the colonies of the portuguese empire. the asian colonies contained more portuguese females than was previously thought. bernard sta maria wrote that \"from 1545, king john iii began to send to india (and the far east) with all pomp and distinction many young portuguese women known as \\'orphans of the queen\\' to be married with local young men.\" both noble and non-noble girls were in the órfãs do rei. since these girls were specifically designated as the \"king\\'s\", the portuguese government paid for their care and upbringing before and after they were sent to portuguese india. goa in particular received most of the girls. some were also sent to the colony of brazil. the \"shelter of the castle\" was one of the organizations which arranged for the órfãs do rei to be sent overseas. the age limits were 12–30 years of age. they departed from lisbon and other portuguese cities and arrived in portuguese india, most of them were sent to goa. incentives such as dowries were given with the girls to potential husbands. the dowries consisted of official positions or land. regarding the timespan of the órfãs do rei being sent overseas, it was said that \"the system apparently continued to function intermittently until the (early) eighteenth century.\" in particular, extensive boatloads of girls and their dowries were sent by queen catarina de austria. during the iberian union, the habsburg king of portugal continued the policy of sending female orphans to goa, ignoring protests from the portuguese authorities there. being \"white, catholic, and of good birth\" were the requirements for a girl to become an órfão do rei. the reason that the authorities protested against the king sending the órfãs to india was the lack of husbands. a proponent of the continued shipment of portuguese girls to india was fr. álvaro penteado. one of the aims of shipping the órfãs was to stop portuguese men from marrying women of other races and provide them with portuguese wives. the prevention of mixed-marriage would have resulted in a greater amount of white portuguese. the sex ratio between men and women in goa was skewed, and the shipments of órfãs do rei was an attempt to correct this. frederick charles danvers wrote in 1894 that \"it had for some time been customary to send out orphan girls to india, from orphanages at lisbon, with the view of getting them husbands and so providing for them, and, at the same time, with the view of furnishing wives of their own nation to the portuguese in india, to prevent them from marrying native indian women. in many instances these orphans were also provided with dowries by the state, which occasionally took the form of appointments in the government service, which, though given to the girls themselves, were of course intended to be filled by their husbands. appointments were similarly given to the daughters of indian officials on their marriage, in consideration of the good services rendered to the state by their respective parents; in one case this dowry took the form of the appointment of governor of cranganor.\" afonso de albuquerque also brought in portuguese orphan girls to portuguese malacca in order to colonize the area. one tale related how some dutch privateers seized a ship with portuguese orphan girls and took them as brides. james talboys wheeler wrote in 1881 that \"it was the custom of the king of portugal to send a number of well-born orphan girls every year to goa, with sufficient dowries to procure them husbands in portuguese india. donna lucia was one of three portuguese orphan girls of good family who had been sent to india the previous year. the fleet which carried them was attacked by the dutch, who captured some of the ships, and carried off the three damsels to surat. being passably handsome, most eminent merchants in surat were anxious to marry them. all three became protestants, and were provided with protestant husbands. two had gone off with their husbands to java or elsewhere, but donna lucia had married the wealthiest dutchman at surat and remained there. delia valle found, however, to his great joy, that donna lucia was only a protestant in name. she had been obliged to conform publicly to the protestant \"heresy,\" but was a catholic in private, with the knowledge and connivance of her protestant husband\". bahia in brazil received some of the orphans in 1551. françois pyrard of laval in his account of his voyages, observed some portuguese merchants, when their ship was in danger, \"it was a very miracle that saved us, for the wind was from the sea, and we were so close ashore that we had great difficulty in doubling the point and getting out. i believe more than 1,500 crowns\\' worth of vows were made, which were afterwards duly paid. the principal merchant made one of 800 cruzados: to wit, 400 for an orphan girl to marry withal, and 400 for a lamp and other utensils for a shrine of our lady that is hard by. as soon as he set foot on land he sought out an orphan girl, and fulfilled his promise to her, as also to the churchwardens of the said church. many others, too, did the like; nor did any fail therein, according to his means and the extent of his vows. it is a custom of the portuguese, when they are in peril, to make these vows; but the worst of it is that it makes them indolent and careless about working stoutly to save their lives.\" 1,000 xerafins were added to the dowry by conde de redondo in order to attract suitors for the orphans. female orphans born in india did not have the same privileges as the órfãs do rei. some órfãs do rei married native rulers who were either in exile or allied to the portuguese. the exiled former ruler (liwali) of pemba converted to christianity from islam and was married to an órfã do rei named dona anna de sepulveda in 1607. he also changed his name to felipe da gama, dom filipe, or philip. however, he later reverted to islam. a son, estevão was born of their marriage. he was exiled from pemba to mombasa in 1596. in the 1500s the exiled ruler of the maldives, hassan converted to christianity and also married a portuguese orphan. her name was d. francisca de vasconcelos. the portuguese girls also in goa married native high caste christians. one of the portuguese orphans kidnapped by the dutch privateer ended up in akbar the great\\'s harem. dating back to the mid-1960s, with intercollegiate competition beginning in 1977, bowling at morehead state university is a club sport and is affiliated with the collegiate division of the united states bowling congress. the larry wilson university lanes, built in 1967, are housed in the laughlin health building on the campus of morehead state university. the six-lane center, open to the campus community, serves as the practice facility for the msu bowling teams. during the 2006-2007 academic year, the center was completely remodeled. the lanes are now equipped with brunswick a-2 pin spotters and were resurfaced with the state-of-the-art kegel edge synthetic lane surface. the larry wilson university lanes are one of two bowling facilities in the united states to use this surface. the settee and counter areas were refurbished with new flooring, lighting, and furniture. new masking units were added as well. the lanes are maintained using the kegel phoenix-s. this machine is capable of having oil patterns uploaded, allowing the teams to prepare on patterns more similar to tournament conditions. adjacent to the larry wilson university lanes is a team room to be used for storage of equipment by bowling team members as well as pro shop equipment. in 2009 the facility acquired a fully functional pro-shop to aid the msu bowling team in getting all of their equipment drilled without having to travel to any surrounding bowling center. the center is also usbc sanctioned. also over the summer, the old pins were replaced with the new synthetic twister pins. the msu women have won national championships in 1989, 1998, 2000 and 2002, were runners-up in 1993, and finished in third place in 2006 and 2008. since 2002, the morehead state women\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 six times, from the 2002-2003 season up to the 2007-2008 season. since 2002, the morehead state men\\'s bowling team has finished in the top 10 in 2002–2003 and 2004–2005 seasons. the men\\'s squad was runner-up in its 2003 tournament and took third place in 2005. the morehead state men\\'s team also made a trip to nationals in 2016 in wichita, kansas. current and former eagle bowlers represent the best that the sport has to offer. four msu bowlers have represented the united states of america in international competition as members of team usa: joy esterson (2004), liz johnson (1994–96, 2008–present), kelly kulick (1998–2001, 2008–present), and david o\\'sullivan (2007). members of junior team usa have also included three eagles: lindsey coulles (2003–04), joy esterson (2003), and david o\\'sullivan (2004). former lady eagle robin (crawford) orlikowski represents her native country as a member of team canada (2000–present). 4. \"bowlers deserve support.\" the trail blazer

bal-sagoth, keyboardist with the band kull, former bassist with the unsigned uk thrash band igniter, and frequent collaborator with the band my dying bride. maudling\\'s primary instruments are roland synthesizers when playing live. he comes from a musical family and was classically trained on piano from an early age. he has contributed to three my dying bride studio albums, provided session orchestration on material by sermon of hypocrisy, and played guest keyboards on a full-length release by the ukrainian metal band semargl. he composed music for the video game adellion. currently maudling is a producer and engineer, operating his own recording studio called waylands forge studios in yorkshire, england. although he composes music mostly in the symphonic metal/black metal genres, maudling\\'s main influences include mostly non-metal bands such as the police, tangerine dream, queen, pat metheny, as well as classical composers such as wagner, stravinsky, tchaikovsky, messiaen and holst.[citation needed] maudling was born in kent and grew up in sheffield, yorkshire. in kent, maudling\\'s parents lived opposite a music store. the store owner, terry bradford, who ended up representing britain on the tv show a song for europe in the 1970s, was a friend of maudling\\'s father and received free records, most of which were classical, contemporary music and jazz.[citation needed]jonny grew up listening to these records, educating himself in a wide variety of musical styles. he had private piano instruction, working through the royal academy of music grade system under elizabeth hydes.[citation needed] at school in south yorkshire, he learnt to play guitar and bass guitar. he played in various bands in his teen years, performing gigs in pubs and nightclubs around the area. he started song writing at this time. he bought his first synthesizer in the mid 1980s with the money he earned working on saturdays. after completing school, maudling tried out for music college, but was considered a borderline candidate with substandard sight-reading ability. he opted instead to concentrate on band work.[citation needed] in the late 1980s and early 1990s maudling played bass, sang and composed songs for a thrash metal outfit called igniter. this band recorded two demos and performed gigs around england, the most high profile of which was a support slot with prominent thrash metal outfit xentrix through alistair maclatchy, a former bandmate in systematic insanity with prominent extreme metal drummer nicholas barker, maudling was introduced to vocalist/lyricist byron roberts in 1993. for several years, roberts had been looking for talented musicians with whom to launch his symphonic black metal band bal-sagoth, but had been unable to meet anyone willing to commit to the project. as a result of maclatchy\\'s introductions, jonny, his brother chris and byron began working together in a band environment. this new outfit went loosely under the provisional name of \"dusk\" for several months, as maclatchy did not like the name bal-sagoth, nor the symphonic black metal direction which roberts had suggested. because of creative and musical differences in direction and style, the band soon parted ways with maclatchy. with the introduction of keyboards, the band found their focus. roberts had the creative team he had long sought to execute his conceptual vision. for maudling, this represented an opportunity for creative musical freedom. roberts, an english post-grad with an interest in 20th century pulp sci-fi writers, could finally implement the ideas he had had for years. the formal inception of bal-sagoth occurred during the summer of 1993. on the strength of their demo which they recorded during december 1993, the band were signed by cacophonous records, a then small subsidiary of vinyl solution based in london. later, they would sign to nuclear blast for three albums, recording a total of six albums to date. maudling composes the music for bal-sagoth, sometimes incorporating ideas from his brother, guitarist chris. he played drums on the first three albums and during subsequent tours, using a session keyboard player, but in 1999 maudling opted to concentrate full-time on keyboards, handing drum duties off to dave mackintosh (dragonforce). maudling also played keyboards on the my dying bride albums the light at the end of the world and the dreadful hours, and composed and recorded all the music for the my dying bride release evinta, based on the existing compositions as originally written by andrew craighan, hamish glencross, et al. he has also contributed keyboard session work to bands including semargl and sermon of hypocrisy. in february 2013, maudling helmed kull, a new project in the symphonic metal sphere. in october 2017 it was announced that maudling had provided orchestration for the new elvenking album secrets of the magick grimoire.[citation needed] on 24 may 2019 the debut album of maudling\\'s new musical project \"kull\" was released by the swedish independent label black lion records. maudling has used various keyboards and synthesizers over the years including casio cz-1000, yamaha dx21, korg m1, roland xp-50 and roland fantom x7, korg kronos x. mister bones (robert todd) is a fictional character in the dc comics universe, created by roy thomas, dann thomas, and todd mcfarlane, in infinity, inc. #16 (july 1985). a former low-level supervillain, he reformed and joined the infinity inc. team, then later the (fictional) department of extranormal operations (a government agency which regulates superhero activity) as a bureaucrat, eventually rising to the rank of regional director for the eastern seaboard. thus, he now wears a suit and tie instead of a costume, and is also known as director bones. a chain-smoker, he had a habit of speaking in rhyme in early appearances, but he no longer does so. keith david provides the voice of mister bones in stargirl. dr. benjamin (also known as amos) love, a gynecologist, injected six pregnant women with an experimental mutagenic drug. each of the women gave birth to a metahuman child. dr. love kidnapped the infants and raised them himself, never allowing them to leave the house. the children learned all they knew from books, radio, and television. later, the six young adults learned the true story of their origin from reading love\\'s diary and confronted him. they decided to execute him for what he did to them and bones took dr. love out in the desert alone to kill him with his cyanide touch; the doctor begged for his life and bones felt pity for him and let him go. bones later showed the rest of his \"family\" the grave of dr. love. after the supposed death of dr. love, taking their cue from the superheroes they had watched on television, the six created costumes to go with the names doctor love had given them and called their group helix. the team kidnapped the infinitor fury in an attempt to extort money. although they were defeated by fury\\'s teammates, infinity, inc., helix managed to escape. later, the second wildcat (yolanda montez) learned that she was in fact a cousin of helix\\'s new member, carcharo, and that they are both products of the same genetic experiments as helix. the two teams battled to a stalemate and mr. bones was arrested while the others escaped. later, mr. bones was freed from prison by dr. love. carcharo soon turned on the helix and kidnapped mr. bones. in the ensuing struggle carcharo is stabbed with a long piece of metal and in a last-ditch effort bit bones\\' leg off, and then died from cyanide poisoning (see powers and abilities). to make sure bones got medical care, helix turned themselves in to the authorities. mr. bones received an artificial leg and dr. beth chapel (doctor midnight) helped him recover from his injuries, and the two formed a friendly relationship. since they were minors, an informal court hearing was held to determine the fate of the members of helix. it was found that mr. bones had too much of a negative influence on them. infinity, inc. was given custody of bones while the rest of the helix would receive treatment. for most of his time with infinity, inc. mr. bones was not a member of the team even though he took an active part in their adventures and became a hero in his own right, and was eventually accepted by most of the infinitors. during the wedding of hector and lyta hall, harlequin (marcie cooper) used deception to have bones and skyman meet at solomon grundy\\'s room. she then deceived solomon grundy into grabbing bones\\' arm and using him to kill skyman with his cyanide touch. wracked with guilt, bones left infinity, inc. when dr. love gained control of helix and ordered them to kill bones, helix instead turned on love, killing him. helix then left in disgust, telling bones he was no longer one of them. the infinitors, though, granted bones full membership in the team, but bones\\' role in skyman\\'s death would end up being instrumental in their disbanding soon afterward. at some point after infinity, inc. disbanded, mr. bones became director of a local branch of the u.s. department of extranormal operations (d.e.o.), and as a d.e.o., director bones has had numerous interactions with the operations of the superhuman community. he has at times asked various dcu teams for their covert assistance. notably, he has worked with the justice society of america a few times, to the point that mister terrific infiltrated the d.e.o. headquarters to tell mr. bones to stop harassing them. bones was also wary of atom smasher, his old fellow infinitor, after his murder of extant. mr. bones became a supporting character in manhunter. mr. bones and the operations of the d.e.o. are featured in the dc files secret files and origins year 2000 special. in a final crisis tie-in, mr. bones is seen as one of the fallen during a strike against wonder woman\\'s female furies in blüdhaven, with count vertigo and negative woman. he later survived the encounter as he is seen with atom smasher in a bar in justice society of america (vol. 2) #27 discussing the aforementioned incident and the latter\\'s position on the team. when rothstein leaves with other society members, bones is seen on the telephone calling the global peace agency. in 2011, \"the new 52\" rebooted the dc universe. mr. bones is shown to be acting as the d.e.o.\\'s director and tasks agent cameron chase with capturing batwoman. bones now believes himself to be col. jacob kane\\'s illegitimate son. [a] he captures beth kane, sister of batwoman, and blackmails batwoman into agreeing to uncover batman\\'s secret identity. batwoman, col. kane\\'s \"murder of crows\" elite paramilitary group, and the heroine hawkfire fail to rescue beth. agent asaf, compromised by hawkfire, shoots bones in the head after he threatens to kill beth rather than hand her over. [b] asaf later says bones was mentally unbalanced, and is not jacob kane\\'s son. in the pages of \"infinite frontier\", mister bones is talking to cameron chase about the recent events that have transpired since the events of \"dark nights: death metal\" that revealed the multiverse to everyone. while on earth omega, mister bones was revealed to have shot down cameron chase ship and says that he made a deal with darkseid to spare their earth in exchange for others. jade knocks down mister bones. after darkseid has teleported all the heroes off of earth omega and back to their respectful earths, mister bones was mentioned to have gotten away upon being returned to prime-earth. bones\\' mother\\'s exposure to mutagenic drugs during pregnancy gave him three superhuman powers, two of which are extremely inconvenient to his daily life: first, his skin (which, it has been indicated, would otherwise be black), flesh, and organs are all transparent, giving him the appearance of a denuded skeleton (thus his name); second, his skin constantly exudes a cyanide-based compound (in effect a toxic sweat), which is almost invariably lethal to anyone who touches him (as a corollary, he is immune to cyanide poisoning); third, he possesses superhuman strength. mister bones is featured in the smallville season 11 digital comic based on the tv series. during world war ii, the man who would become mister bones was a member of, and presumably the leader of, a government task force codenamed \"shadowpact\", created to counter the axis thule society. other members included felix faust and john zatara, though the latter left the team after their first mission. at some point, shadowpact came into contact with the olympian god hades, who promised them eternal youth if they aided him in escaping from the prison he had been sealed in by his brother, zeus, and the queen of the amazon tribe, hippolyta. bones could not fulfill his end of the bargain and was punished by the ancient deity, who used magic to turn bones\\' skin, muscles and organs invisible and stain his bones black, giving the agent the appearance of a walking skeleton. in the present, bones is the head of the government agency d.e.o. and uses a weekly treatment with body paint to appear normal and carry out day-to-day matters. mister bones appears in the cw live-action television series stargirl, voiced by keith david. this version is the director of the helix institute for youth rehabilitation. after being alluded to in the episode \"summer school: chapter ten\", his subordinate nurse louise love informs him of blue valley\\'s super-powered individuals and he makes plans to visit it in the episode \"summer school: chapter thirteen\". crematogaster cornigera is a species of ant in tribe

hungarian dramatic soprano. guszalewicz was born in budapest, and in 1896, at the age of seventeen, married opera singer eugen guszalewicz. she studied with her husband and made her debut in 1903 at the theater of bern, in switzerland. in 1905, she sang at the cologne opera as the queen of sheba in la reine de saba by gounod, and as isolde in wagner\\'s masterpiece. shortly after her role in tristan, she was offered a six-year contract to sing in cologne. guszalewicz continued to sing in cologne until 1916 and toured throughout europe. she also sang in several operas and gave recitals in karlsruhe (1906), düsseldorf (1907), bremen (1908) and dresden (1908). in dresden at the semperoper, she performed the title role in salome for the first time. her interpretation of salome caused a sensation. for many years, however, a picture of her performance was thought to in fact show the play\\'s author, wilde in women\\'s drag. the picture was even reproduced in richard ellmann\\'s biography of him. it was not until wilde\\'s grandson merlin holland corrected scholars in 1994 that the picture in fact showed guszalewicz. this correction undermined readings of wilde as a cross-dresser. she performed at the leipzig opera (1908), at the vienna state opera (1910 in the role of salome), at the berlin state opera (1911 as brünnhilde and as isolde), as well as in brussels, paris and madrid. in 1905, she sang the lead role in isidore de lara\\'s opera messaline in cologne, which was a great success for her. the opera had 27 performances. guszalewicz gave concerts at the opera in frankfurt am main (1907), at the stadttheater of bremen (1908) and at the national theatre munich (1910 as salome). her repertoire included the roles of leonore in fidelio, adriano in rienzi, venus in tannhäuser, the title role of ingwelde in max von schillings\\' opera, elektra (opera) in the opera of richard strauss, berthe in le prophète by meyerbeer, santuzza in cavalleria rusticana, the title role in mascagni\\'s amica, and maria in a basso porto by niccola spinelli. after ending her career, she worked as a teacher in munich. her daughter genia guszalewicz (1902–71) became one of her students, and she followed her mother into a career as an opera singer. alice guszalewicz died at the age of 61 in munich, germany. gordon marion graham (february 16, 1918 – march 22, 2008) was a united states air force lieutenant general. graham was a combat pilot who, during world war ii was credited with 7 aerial victories making him a flying ace. he is credited with a further 9.5 aircraft destroyed on the ground. by the end of world war ii, graham had flown 73 combat missions in the p-51 mustang. graham was born in ouray, colorado, in 1918. he attended taft high school in taft,

phyllis jane blakeney. he was appointed to the senate for the saint john, new brunswick division on 14 february 1964 as nominated by prime minister lester b. pearson. rattenbury remained in that role until his death on 27 may 1973. proton mail (also written as protonmail) is an end-to-end encrypted email service founded in 2013 in geneva, switzerland. it uses client-side encryption to protect email content and user data before they are sent to proton mail servers, unlike other common email providers such as gmail and outlook.com. the service can be accessed through a webmail client, the tor network, or dedicated ios and android apps. proton mail is run by proton ag (formerly proton technologies), which is based in the canton of geneva. the company also operates proton vpn, proton drive and proton calendar. proton mail received initial funding through a crowdfunding campaign. although the default account setup is free, the service is sustained by optional paid services. initial membership was by invitation only, however beginning in march 2016, proton mail was opened to the public. acquiring no fewer than 2 million users by 2017, membership grew to almost 70 million by 2022. on 16 may 2014, proton mail entered into public beta. it was met with enough response that after three days they needed to temporarily suspend beta signups to expand server capacity. two months later, proton mail received us$550,377 from 10,576 donors through a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo, while aiming for us$100,000. during the campaign, paypal froze proton mail\\'s paypal account, thereby preventing the withdrawal of us$251,721 worth of donations. paypal stated that the account was frozen due to doubts of the legality of encryption, statements that opponents said were unfounded. the restrictions were lifted the following day. on 18 march 2015, proton mail received us$2 million from the non-profit fondation genevoise pour l\\'innovation technologique (fongit) and charles river ventures, although by 2022, the company no longer had venture capital investors. on 14 august 2015, proton mail released major version 2.0, which included a rewritten codebase for its web interface. on 17 march 2016, proton mail released major version 3.0, which saw the official launch of proton mail out of beta. with a new interface for the web client, version 3.0 also included the public launch of proton mail\\'s ios and android beta applications. on 19 january 2017, proton mail announced a tor onion site. on 21 november 2017, proton mail introduced proton mail contacts, a zero-access encryption contacts manager. proton mail contacts also utilizes digital signatures to verify the integrity of contacts data. on 6 december 2017, proton mail launched proton mail bridge, an application that provides end-to-end email encryption to any desktop client that supports imap and smtp, such as microsoft outlook, mozilla thunderbird, and apple mail, for windows and macos. on 25 july 2018, proton mail introduced address verification and pretty good privacy (pgp) support, making proton mail interoperable with other pgp clients. the source code for the back-end remains closed source. however, proton mail released the source code for the web interface under an open-source license. proton mail also open sourced their mobile clients for ios and android, as well the proton mail bridge app. all of their source code can be found on github. in september 2020, proton mail helped found the coalition for app fairness, which aims to gain better conditions for the inclusion of their apps in app stores. proton also founded the coalition for competitive digital markets, which brings together 50+ european tech companies supporting open, interoperable and competitive digital markets. in may 2022, proton ag updated the visuals, user interface, and logos of all its products, including proton mail, to achieve a consistent design throughout its software. proton mail\\'s subscription now includes access to all proton vpn, proton calendar, and proton drive. proton mail uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to offer end-to-end encryption. when a user creates a proton mail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private rsa keys: this symmetrical encryption happens in the user\\'s web browser using aes-256. upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account. proton mail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode that requires a login password and a mailbox password. upon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. this is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. the decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. the public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on proton mail servers. thus proton mail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so proton mail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords. this system absolves proton mail from: proton mail exclusively supports https and uses tls with ephemeral key exchange to encrypt all internet traffic between users and proton mail servers. proton mail holds an \"a+\" rating from qualys ssl labs. in september 2015, proton mail added native support to their web interface and mobile app for pgp. this allows a user to export their proton mail pgp-encoded public key to others outside of proton mail, enabling them to use the key for email encryption. the proton mail also supports pgp encryption from proton mail to outside users. proton mail also has support for searching within encrypted message content. an email message sent from one proton mail account to another is automatically encrypted with the public key of the recipient. once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the message. when the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox. email messages sent from proton mail to non-proton mail email addresses may optionally be sent in plain text or with end-to-end encryption. with encryption, the message is encrypted with aes under a user-supplied password. the recipient receives a link to the proton mail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted message. proton mail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a backchannel. such email messages can be set to self-destruct after a period of time. both proton mail and proton vpn are located in switzerland to avoid any surveillance or information requests from countries under the fourteen eyes, and/or under government surveillance laws like the united states\\' patriot act or outside the bounds of law.[citation needed] the company claims that it is also located in switzerland because of its strict privacy laws. proton mail currently supports two-factor authentication with totp tokens for its login process. as of october 2019, according to the official proton mail blog, u2f support for yubikey and fido physical security keys is currently under development and will be available soon after the release of v4.0. in 2021, proton mail\\'s security and cryptographic architecture were both independently audited by securitum, a leading european security auditing company, who uncovered no major issues or security vulnerabilities, and the audit results were publicly published. proton mail limits data portability by locking support for external email client software through imap and pop3 protocols behind a paywall. as of 2021, users are unable to back up their email account locally without paying. proton mail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party. it maintains two data centres, one in lausanne and another in attinghausen (in the former k7 military bunker under 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) of granite) as a backup. since the servers are located in switzerland, they are legally outside of the jurisdiction of the european union, united states, and other countries. under swiss law, all surveillance requests from foreign countries must go through a swiss court and are subject to international treaties. prospective surveillance targets are promptly notified and can appeal the request in court. each data centre uses load balancing across web, mail, and sql servers, redundant power supply, hard drives with full disk encryption, and exclusive use of linux and other open-source software. in december 2014, proton mail joined the ripe ncc in an effort to have more direct control over the surrounding internet infrastructure. from 3 to 7 november 2015, proton mail was under several ddos attacks that made the service largely unavailable to users. during the attacks, the company stated on twitter that it was looking for a new data center in switzerland, saying, \"many are afraid due to the magnitude of the attack against us\". in july 2018, proton mail reported it was once more suffering from ddos attacks. ceo andy yen claimed that the attackers had been paid by an unknown party to launch the attacks. in september 2018, one of the suspected proton mail attackers was arrested by british law enforcement and charged in connection with a series of other high-profile cyberattacks against schools and airlines. on 22 april 2020, proton mail confirmed on its proton vpn twitter that proton mail and proton vpn are banned in china because it doesn\\'t allow the government to spy. on 15 november 2019, proton confirmed that government of the republic of belarus had issued a block across the country of proton mail and proton vpn ip addresses. the block was no longer in place four days later. no explanation was given to proton mail for the block, nor for the block being lifted. on 29 january 2020, the russian federal service for supervision of communications, information technology and mass media reported that it had implemented a complete block of proton mail services within the russian federation. as a reason for the block, it cited proton mail\\'s refusal to give up information relating to accounts that allegedly sent out spam with terror threats. however, proton mail claimed that it did not receive any requests from russian authorities regarding any such accounts. in response to the block, the proton mail twitter account recommended legitimate users circumvent the block via vpns or tor. in march 2020, the company announced that even though the russia ban was not particularly successful and the service continues to be largely available in russia without utilising a vpn, proton mail will be releasing new anti-censorship features in both proton mail and proton vpn desktop and mobile apps which will allow more block attempts to be automatically circumvented. according to proton mail\\'s transparency report, it is legally obligated to follow swiss court orders if swiss law is broken, and in 2020 proton mail received 3,572 orders from swiss authorities and contested 750 of them. due to the encryption utilized, proton mail is unable to hand over the contents of encrypted emails under any circumstances, but according to proton\\'s privacy policy, proton mail can be legally compelled to log ip addresses as part of a swiss criminal investigation. for this reason, the company strongly suggests that users who need to hide their identity from the swiss government use their tor hidden service/onion site. in may 2022, proton updated its privacy policy and made explicit a separate privacy policy for its proton vpn service, which has a different treatment under swiss law and has a strict no-logs policy which was also confirmed by an external audit. notable cases involving swiss court orders include a case involving death threats made against well-known immunologist anthony fauci and a case against french citizens charged with theft and destruction of property. after these cases, in october 2021, proton mail won an important swiss court victory that confirmed that email services cannot be considered telecommunications providers, and consequently are not subject to the data retention requirements imposed on telecommunications providers. as of 25 may 2022[update], proton mail offers the following account types: [c 2] the case method is a teaching approach that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. it developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the casebook method of teaching law pioneered by harvard legal scholar christopher c. langdell. in sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question. rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case. the case method evolved from the casebook method, a mode of teaching based on socratic principles pioneered at harvard law school by christopher c. langdell. like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem. a decision-forcing case is a kind of decision game. like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem. however, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events. a decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study. that is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past. however, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\" this is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision. in other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. in recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations. it is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. it has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. every decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve. thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play. some case teachers, such as those of the marine corps university, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case. (a student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"your majesty, what are your orders?\") other case teachers, such as those at the harvard business school, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\" after discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case. also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at harvard university) \"the \\'b\\' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist. whatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\" rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions. some case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students. one reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case. another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes kirsten lundgren of columbia university, \"can be all the more powerful when the \\'what happened\\' is left unanswered. a classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time. there are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems. a decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\" also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"staff rides\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the united states army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (stabs reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by gerhard von scharnhorst in 1801 and made famous by the elder hellmuth von moltke in the middle years of the nineteenth century. to avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the case method project at the marine corps university in quantico, virginia, adopted the term \"russell ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts. the term is an homage to major general john henry russell jr.,usmc, the 16th commandant of the united states marine corps and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. decision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches. in this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve. a decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\" (the bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an \"open-face\" or \"smørrebrød\" case. a decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions in a relatively short period of time is sometimes called a \"white castle\", \"slider\" case. or \"day in the life\" case. case materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case. commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs. case materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case. materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting. materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (these are called \"the b-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\") materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting. (these are often referred to as \"handouts.\") case materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. these include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts. a number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials. these organizations include: the case centre (formerly the european case clearing house), headquartered in cranfield university, cranfield, bedford, united kingdom, and with its us office at babson college, wellesley, massachusetts, is the independent home of the case method. it is a membership-based organization with more than 500 members worldwide, not-for-profit organisation and registered charity founded in 1973. the case centre is the world’s largest and most diverse repository of case studies used in management education, with cases from the world’s top case publishing schools, including, harvard business school, icfai business school hyderabad, insead, imd, ivey business school, darden school of business, london business school, etc. its stated aim is to promote the case method by sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise in this area among teachers and students, and for this it engages in various activities like conducting case method workshops, offering case scholarships, publishing a journal, and organizing a global case method awards. the case centre awards (known as the european awards from 1991 and 2010) recognises outstanding case writers and teachers worldwide. these prestigious awards, popularly known as the case method community\\'s annual \\'oscars\\', or the “business education oscars, celebrate worldwide excellence in case writing and teaching. the presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem. this can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story. this, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\" that is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. techniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials; awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" – information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case. the case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. in the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right. by exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters. by placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures. by providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue. by providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement. by asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession. in his classic essay on the case method (\"because wisdom can\\'t be told\"), charles i. gragg of the harvard business school argued that \"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\" while the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement. these incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to: thomas w. shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. the instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. with this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\" case materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \"best practices\" fallacies. here are some examples of such disclaimers: the case method is used in a variety of professional schools. these include the: university of fujairah- mba program melissa siegel (born 8 april 1981) is an american academic specialising in migration. she is professor of migration studies at the maastricht

archdiocese of new york, located in dover plains, dutchess county, new york. it was founded in 1866 as a mission of immaculate conception parish of amenia. in 1885 it became a mission of st. john the evangelist\\'s church in pawling, and was finally itself elevated to parish status in 1936. dover plains was a branch mission served first by father michael riordan, pastor of st. peter\\'s, poughkeepsie; then later by denis sheehan, pastor of st. mary\\'s, wappingers falls. in 1859 archbishop hughes appointed rev. charles slevin, as the first resident priest. father slavin became responsible for the whole harlem valley. he resided at dover plains and built the church there. dover plains was chosen as the headquarters for the missions of amenia, beekman, millbrook, millerton, and pawling, where there were no churches. it was father slevin who built st. charles\\' church. he was drafted during the civil war, but his congregation made up the $300 fee to gain his exemption. father slevin left in 1864. his successor, rev. john arsenigo lived in purdy\\'s station. in 1886 father tandy became resident pastor at immaculate conception in amenia, with pawling and dover as missions. with the appointment in 1872 of father healy to st. john the evangelist responsibility for st. charles\\' mission was transferred to pawling. in september 2018, timothy cardinal dolan, archbishop of new york, officially decreed the merger of st. john the evangelist with st. charles borromeo, creating the new parish church of st. john the evangelist-st. charles borromeo. the main parish office is now located in pawling, ny. each church retains its own sunday mass schedule but is served now under one pastor.[citation needed] our lady of solace chapel in nearby wingdale was part of st. charles borromeo parish in dover plains until 2013. the mission chapel was established in 1962 and staffed by capuchin friars. the main purpose of the mission was to serve those at the psychiatric hospital in wingdale—the hospital closed in the 1994, but a juvenile detention center remained open directly across from the church. our lady of solace mission was closed in december 2012 and the property is now owned by olivet management, the corporate name of olivet university. loaves & fishes ministry is a program started by the sisters of the divine compassion, providing companionship, food, and language tutoring to the residents of dover plains and wingdale. the elderly and homebound of the dover plains area are the ministry\\'s target population. loaves & fishes

doctor\\'s offices and hospitals are provided by volunteers. the loaves and fishes works with local agencies, civic groups and the local parish to identify those in need. it also operates a \"backpack program\" providing some elementary school children with backpacks of food for the weekend. the european squadron, also known as the european station, was a part of the united states navy in the late 19th century and the early 1900s. the squadron was originally named the mediterranean squadron and renamed following the american civil war. in 1905, the squadron was absorbed into the north atlantic fleet. the egyptian expedition in june and july 1882 was a response by the united states to the british and french attack on alexandria during the anglo-egyptian war. to protect american citizens and their property within the city, ships of the european squadron, under rear admiral james nicholson, were sent to egypt with orders to observe the conflict ashore and make a landing if necessary. british and french forces heavily damaged the city and started a large fire so a force of marines and sailors were landed and they assisted in fire fighting and guarding the american consulate from insurgents. casper f. goodrich, who served as an executive officer on the uss lancaster, commanded the landing party and would later publish an extensive report on the bombardment. the european squadron returned to u.s. waters at the start of the spanish–american war in april 1898, and did not return to europe until july 1901, when admiral bartlett j. cromwell was placed in command with the cruiser uss chicago as flagship. other ships of the squadron from july 1901 included the cruiser uss albany and the gunboat uss nashville. ikinu is a small town in kenya\\'s central province. ikinu

0.01101001100101101001011001101001... is given by the thue–morse sequence. that is, where tn is the nth element of the prouhet–thue–morse sequence. the prouhet–thue–morse constant can also be expressed, without using tn , as an infinite product, this formula is obtained by substituting x = 1/2 into generating series for tn the continued fraction expansion of the constant is [0; 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 44, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, …] (sequence a014572 in the oeis) yann bugeaud and martine queffélec showed that infinitely many partial quotients of this continued fraction are 4 or 5, and infinitely many partial quotients are greater than or equal to 50. the prouhet–thue–morse constant was shown to be transcendental by kurt mahler in 1929. he also showed that the number is also transcendental for any algebraic number α, where 0 < |α| < 1. yann bugaeud proved that the prouhet–thue–morse constant has an irrationality measure of 2. the prouhet–thue–morse constant appears in

(פני מנחם), after the works he authored, was the seventh rebbe of the hasidic dynasty of ger, a position he held from 1992 until his death in 1996. from 1956 until he was appointed rebbe, he was a rosh yeshiva. he also served as a member and the president of the torah scholars council and as the chairman of the agudat yisrael political party. pinchas menachem was born in falenica, near warsaw, poland. he was the only offspring of the second marriage of his father, rabbi avraham mordechai alter, the fourth rebbe of ger, to feyge mintshe biderman. pinchas menachem had four half-brothers and two half-sisters from his father\\'s first marriage—including the fifth rebbe of ger, rabbi yisrael alter, and rabbi simcha bunim alter, the sixth rebbe of ger. pinchas menachem\\'s bar mitzva took place near ludmir in poland (now western ukraine) not long before the outbreak of world war ii in 1939. after the war, he married his cousin, tzipora alter. in 1956, he was appointed rosh yeshiva of sfas emes, the flagship yeshiva of ger in jerusalem, israel. rabbi pinchas menachem succeeded his half-brother, rabbi simcha bunim alter, to become rebbe in 1992. his position as rosh yeshiva of sfas emes yeshiva was assumed by his son, rabbi shaul alter, who is widely regarded as an eminent talmudic scholar. during his tenure, rabbi pinchas menachem continued the policies of his half-brothers, rabbi simcha bunim and rabbi yisrael, by supporting the political work of the agudat israel of israel party, promoting the interests of haredi judaism in the israeli knesset. he reached a rapprochement with his non-hasidic ashkenazi haredi fellow-rabbis, in particular with rabbi elazar shach, leader of the rival degel hatorah party. together, they created the united torah judaism (yahadut hatorah) party in order not to lose residual votes in the israeli proportional representation system, and thereby potentially obtain an extra seat for the newly united party in knesset elections. rabbi pinchas menachem died in 1996 after less than four years at the helm of the ger dynasty. he was buried beside his father, rabbi avraham mordechai alter, in the courtyard of the sfas emes yeshiva. unlike his father\\'s grave, which was dug by hand under the cover of darkness during the british curfew in 1948, the pnei menachem\\'s grave was dug with machinery; the latter grave is therefore lower than the former. a red-brick ohel was built over the two graves, which are visited frequently by students in the yeshiva. he was succeeded as rebbe by his nephew, rabbi yaakov aryeh alter, son of rabbi simcha bunim alter. in 2019 his son rabbi shaul alter formed his own followership of ger chasidim called kehilas pnei menachem which is independent of the greater ger sect. bixin is an apocarotenoid found in the seeds of the achiote tree (bixa orellana) from which it derives its name. it is commonly extracted from the seeds to form annatto, a natural food coloring, containing about 5% pigments of which 70-80% are bixin. bixin is chemically unstable when isolated and converts via isomerization into trans-bixin (β-bixin), the double-bond isomer. bixin is soluble in fats and alcohols but insoluble in water. upon exposure to alkali, the methyl ester is hydrolyzed to produce the dicarboxylic acid norbixin, a water-soluble derivative. robert a. lanier (born july 24, 1968) is

is a natural region of southern-central sardinia, italy. etymology the name \"marmilla\" comes from the vast rounded hills, probably resembling udders (see marmilla castle in las plassas). another hypothesis is that according to which given the presence of many marshes in the area, the landscape could appear dotted with \"a thousand seas\". tourism in the marmilla can rely on various factors ranging from environmental assets, to the numerous nuragic centers in the area, to architectural works. in particular, we note: environmental assets: giara of gesturi monte arci natural park nuragic centers: nuragic village of su nuraxi in barumini, nuraghe cuccurada in mogoro, archaeological area nuraghe sa fogaia in siddi tomb of the giants \"sa domu e s\\'orcu\" in siddi genna maria complex in

it is delimited from east and south by the campidano, from north-west by monte arci, from north by the giara di gesturi and the giara di serri, and from east by the flumini mannu. geologically, most of marmilla dates to the miocene period, and is thus substantially younger than the rest of sardinia. the landscape is mostly hilly, and human economical activities in the area include agriculture (prevalently cereals and fava beans) and tourism. marmilla was inhabited since prehistoric times, as testified by the presence of nuraghe. to the carthaginian domination date the fortress of genoni. during the middle ages it was part of the giudicato of arborea and of the giudicato of cagliari. coordinates: .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output

\"bursting apart\") is the 82nd sura of the qur\\'an, with 19 ayat. the chapter is named \\'al-infitar\\' because of the occurrence of the word \\'unfatarat\\' in the first verse of this chapter. infitar means \\'split asunder\\': the word \\'unfatarat\\' is used in this chapter in order to describe the splitting of the sky on the day of judgment. this chapter (al-infitar), along with chapters at-takwir and al-inshiqaq, provides an exhaustive description about the \\'day of judgment\\'. the first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the qur\\'an is found in hadith of prophet muhammad. although scholars including ibn taymiyyah claim that muhammad has commented on the whole of the qur\\'an, others including ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the qur\\'an. ḥadīth (حديث) is literally \"speech\" or \"report\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of muhammad validated by isnad; with sirah rasul allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. according to aishah, the life of prophet muhammad was practical implementation of qur\\'an. therefore, mention in hadith elevates the importance of the pertinent surah from a certain perspective. nechama tec (née bawnik) (born 15 may 1931) is a professor emerita of sociology at the university of connecticut. she received her ph.d. in sociology at columbia university,

completed a number of fine works of his own including the performing arts centre in esbjerg. born on 27 september 1944 in stockholm, utzon was brought up first at hellebæk near helsingør in the north of zealand until the family moved to australia in 1957. he studied at the school of architecture in sydney (1964–66) and at the royal danish academy of fine arts in copenhagen (1966–1970). deeply influenced by his father\\'s approach to architecture, jan utzon soon began to collaborate with him taking on key supervisory tasks in major projects such as the kuwait national assembly building. in many cases, it is difficult to estimate to division of responsibility in projects undertaken by utzon associates where jan worked both with his father and his brother kim. these include the paustian house in copenhagen and the skagen odde nature centre in the north of jutland. jan also set up his own design office on funen where he authored many interesting projects. one of his most successful is the performing arts centre in esbjerg (1997) with its theatre and concert hall combined with the earlier art museum. its large communal foyer catering both to the concert hall and the museum is particularly appealing and was achieved on a modest budget. utzon architects and johnson pilton walker, architects in collaboration, have explored options to improve the existing opera theatre at the sydney opera house. utzon has also been active in the developing countries. working for tvind, he built the shamva, zimbabwe, headquarters for the humana people to people organisation, as well as a large training and conference centre at san juan de las pulgas near ensenada in mexico\\'s baja california (2008). paustian house, copenhagen, in collaboration with jørn utzon and kim utzon skagen odde nature centre, north jutland, in collaboration with jørn utzon the acanti are a race of fictional whale-like, extraterrestrial beings appearing in american comic books published by marvel comics. they have appeared in uncanny x-men within the marvel comics universe. they were created by writer chris claremont and artist dave cockrum. many of them were enslaved by the brood empire. the acanti roughly resemble whales. they are a reddish-brown color. they have dorsal, ventral, lateral, and caudal fins, as well as green eyes widely spaced on their heads. the acanti are large space-faring creatures most closely resembling earth\\'s whale shark. an adult acanti can grow to a few kilometers in length, and even an infant is large enough to swallow a 15-person spaceship with room to take in at least four more. they are sentient creatures which communicate through psionic sounds referred to as songs. acanti have the innate ability to fly faster than the speed of light, without technological assistance. according to myth, the acanti are an ancient species which peacefully wandered through space, benevolent and compassionate by nature. the acanti were led by one individual known as the prophet-singer. the prophet-singer was the repository of the acanti\\'s racial soul, a collective semi-mystical force that linked and motivated the acanti species. as death approached, the acanti typically hurled themselves into stars. the prophet-singer of each generation would also do so, releasing the soul to join the body of the next prophet-singer. upon migrating to the milky way galaxy, the brood began to enslave the acanti to take advantage of their natural ability to travel at speeds exceeding light. the brood would infect individual acanti with a disease known as the slaver virus, which would destroy the higher cognitive functions of their minds, making them ripe for easy control. then, the brood would transform the mindless husks into living starships. the brood succeeded in enslaving the acanti prophet-singer, and when he eventually died and crashed on a planet, its body was reconstructed as the \"throne city\" (presumably like a capital) on the planet (referred to as \"broodworld\" or \"sleazeworld\") that the brood then established as the center of their empire. thus, the soul remained trapped in the skull of the dead prophet-singer. salvation for the acanti came when a new prophet-singer was born, however, without transferring the soul to him, the acanti were still stuck near sleazeworld. during the x-men\\'s first conflict with the brood the x-men had been abducted and infected by the brood and brought to their homeworld. carol danvers (formerly ms. marvel) became linked with a white hole and transformed into binary. the process made her temporarily insane, and she blasted out of lilandra\\'s yacht, causing an explosive decompression that sucked storm into space, where she was found by the newborn prophet-singer, whose mother had just been enslaved by the brood. storm herself was now becoming a brood as the egg began to hatch. the prophet-singer saved storm (who had destroyed the egg and critically wounded herself). other acanti merged storm\\'s consciousness with that of the prophet-singer while storm\\'s body healed in a cocoon within him. the acanti saved storm, entering into a symbiotic relationship in which the acanti healed storm\\'s body, purging it of the brood embryo, and storm\\'s experienced mind provided a source of focus and strength for the baby prophet-singer. the acanti then swallowed liliandra\\'s yacht, masking it from brood sensors while the crew effected repairs. the x-men then agreed to release the soul from broodworld. after a battle against the brood, binary succeeded in releasing the soul from the crystalline room in which it was trapped. the foul nature of the brood queen and the embryos within the x-men immediately resonated as black pools throughout the chamber. the grateful soul purged the x-men of the brood embryos and transformed the brood queen into pure inanimate crystal. the soul united with the young prophet-singer, who assumed leadership of the acanti. recently, however, the brood attempted to invade earth using a fleet of acanti ships, though ones without external domes. it is unknown whether these were leftovers from before the x-men freed the prophet-singer, or whether the brood have continued their depredations on the acanti even afterwards. the fleet was scared away from earth with a telepathic illusion of the phoenix force and galactus. one acanti was obtained by roxxon energy corporation. with a riding device added to it, the acanti was controlled by an unidentified brood-infected human working for dario agger in his plot to hire weapon h into working for roxxon. weapon h used his punch to defeat the acanti. although not named, in the ultimate fantastic four #35 (dec. 2006) there is a huge alien creature, used by the acheron empire, ruled by thanos, that resembles the acanti. an acanti appears in the x-men episode \"love in vain\". enslaved by the brood (here called \"the colony\") to be their vessel, it is freed when professor x uses his psychic powers to break the brood\\'s control. the brood cannot stand the acanti\\'s song while the x-man rogue finds it beautiful. ren (katherine) powell (born karen lee tudor in

purchased by the diocese of las cruces, new mexico. the hurd-larinconada gallery, owned by artist michael hurd, is located here. the gallery displays original works of art by the wyeth and hurd families and there are guest houses on the ranch. in the 1850s, hispanic settlers moved to the area, which caused conflict with the native apache. according to an interview with frank coe, these settlers lived in placitas, or \"adobe family compounds enclosed for defensive purposes.\" some still survive in the 21st century. historic documents collected by the new mexico department of transportation note: in his book frontier fighter, george coe describes the late 1800s houses in san patricio as being \"built for defense with thick adobe walls and portholes on top.\" robery utley\\'s book high noon in lincoln describes san patricio in the 1870s as made up of \"some 15 adobe buildings scattered along a single street.\" in the following decades, european-american settlers began to move here as well. the town was estimated to have about 40 families in 1867. that year the first acequia in the hondo valley was dug in san patricio. around 1870, the town was named ruidoso after the nearby river. several years later it was renamed after a catholic church built here: la iglesia de san patricio. this church, also known as the san patricio catholic church, was the first church in the area. it became an important cultural center for the residents. similar churches of this type are found throughout the hondo valley. san patricio was the site of a battle in the lincoln county war. it was associated with billy the kid, who attended dances in town during the 1870s. in 1878, james dolan and his allies, including the rio grande posse, vandalized the town and stole and killed horses. by the 1920s, the population grew to 822. artists peter hurd and his wife henriette wyeth moved to the area in the 1930s, starting a farm of 40 acres. they were the first among numerous artists to live in the area and eventually had a 2200-acre ranch. during world war ii the population declined. postwar development followed highway construction, and businesses moved to follow the changing path of u.s. route 70. in 1967, st. jude\\'s church was built, consolidating the congregations of all nearby catholic churches in the hondo valley. the coordinates of san patricio are 33°24′32″n 105°19′37″w\\ufeff / \\ufeff33.40889°n 105.32694°w\\ufeff / 33.40889; -105.32694 (33.408976, -105.326928). the elevation is 5436 feet (1657 m). san patricio is located near the confluence of rio ruidoso and rio bonito. glencoe is to the west and hondo to the east. after their confluence, the rivers become the rio hondo. the catholic community in glencoe attends st. jude\\'s church in san patricio. this church incorporated the bells from the historical glencoe and hondo catholic churches, and san patricio church. u.s. route 70 serves the town, which is a 16.5 mile drive from sierra blanca regional airport. the community and region are known for growing apples; the orchards were a major part of the economy until the mid-1900s. other orchard fruits, like peaches, pears, and cherries, and more general agricultural products were also sold to truckers along with the apples. floods in 1941 and 1965, and the threat of cold weather have been the main dangers to these orchards. early businesses of san patricio included a general store, a grocery shop, a bar, a pool hall, a post office, and a gas station. in the early 2000s, only the post office is still operating. san patricio built its first school before 1880. the school district included 70 students in 1880 and 153 in 1920. the four-room elementary school closed in 1960 after the smaller school districts in the area consolidated to hondo\\'s elementary school. bride and groom is an old-time radio human-interest program in the united states. it was broadcast on abc from november 26, 1945 to september 15,

with members of the audience. he would usually speak with married couples who were celebrating significant anniversary milestones, who would be given gifts such as matching wristwatches. after the ceremony, the newlyweds returned to the studio where they received wedding gifts provided by sponsors, such as refrigerators, stoves, silverware and jewelry, as a reward for participating in the program. the 30-minute program was sponsored by sterling drug until january 2, 1950. radio historian john dunning wrote, \"during its five-year run, bride and groom told the stories of almost 1,000 new couples.\" couples who were ready to marry provided information about themselves to the show\\'s staff. applications were reviewed by director john reddy or a panel of judges. as a matter of policy, the show excluded divorcees from consideration. roman catholic couples were also not cast because their faith would have required them to be married in a catholic church. couples married on the show ranged in age from teenagers to octogenarians. on occasion, the show featured celebrity couples, such as radio personality bud collyer and actress marian shockley in 1948. john nelson was the

written by alan plater, the plot concerns the disappearance of the husband of leeds schoolteacher judy threadgold (bridget turner). investigating the disappearance, with the aid of her colleague, woodwork teacher neville keaton (alun armstrong), judy learns of the existence of a secret organisation that helps disaffected people leave their unhappy lives behind. alan plater\\'s the beiderbecke affair (1985) started out as a sequel to get lost! but was rewritten with new characters when alun armstrong proved unavailable to reprise the role of neville keaton. the plot of get lost! concerns the disappearance of jim threadgold (brian southwood), husband of english teacher judy threadgold (turner). aided by her colleague, woodwork teacher neville keaton (armstrong), judy sets out to find out what has happened to her husband. judy and neville soon discover the existence of a secret organisation dedicated to assisting people who want to escape the mundanity of their lives and families and just disappear. although judy eventually finds her missing husband, she is none too enthusiastic about taking him back and allows him to seek a new life running a fish and chip shop. her adversarial relationship with neville blossoms into a love affair. alan plater had begun writing for television in the early 1960s and had been a regular writer on the police series z-cars (1962–78) and its spin-off series softly, softly (1966–69) and softly, softly: taskforce (1969–76). he had also written several plays for the bbc and itv and created and wrote the sitcom oh no, it\\'s selwyn froggitt! (1974). plater\\'s scripts were noted for their strong depiction of the lives of the inhabitants of northern england. in 1978, plater was commissioned by david cunliffe, an executive producer at yorkshire television (ytv), to adapt j. b. priestley\\'s the good companions as a thirteen part serial. plater was only able to stretch the plot to fill nine episodes and so offered to write four episodes of what he called a \"non-violent thriller\" to make up the balance. using characters inspired by nick and nora charles, the detectives in the film the thin man (1934) and its sequels, plater sought to juxtapose the conventions of the hardboiled thriller, as expounded by the likes of raymond chandler and dashiell hammett, with the mundanity of life in yorkshire. the plot was inspired by a newspaper article that reported that 20,000 people went missing in the uk each year. in creating his two protagonists – neville keaton and judy threadgold (named after sunderland goalkeeper harry threadgold) – plater hit upon the idea of making them schoolteachers, saying, \"i tried to think of the least likely place to find two detectives and i came up with a staffroom of a comprehensive school in leeds\". plater apportioned elements of his own interests to his two heroes, making judy an environmental campaigner and neville a football and jazz fan. neville\\'s love of jazz is reflected in the serial\\'s soundtrack which features re-recordings, by frank ricotti and featuring kenny baker, of tracks by the likes of duke ellington. cast as neville keaton was alun armstrong who, at the time, had worked with the national theatre and the royal shakespeare company and would later go on to enjoy a varied television career with roles in such programmes as our friends in the north (1996), this is personal: the hunt for the yorkshire ripper (2000) and new tricks (2003–2013). judy threadgold was played by bridget turner, an actress best known for her stage work, especially works by alan ayckbourn, and had previously appeared in episodes of sutherland\\'s law (1973–76) and target (1977–78). the series was mainly filmed around the leeds area. settings included: get lost! aired to respectable ratings – averaging 10.9 million viewers across its run – and plater soon began work on a sequel. when it transpired than alun armstrong would not be available to reprise the role of neville keaton, plater decided that, rather than recasting the role, he would create two new characters and rewrite the scripts. the sequel to get lost! was reworked by plater into what was to become the beiderbecke affair (1985), the first serial in what was to become known as the beiderbecke trilogy. get lost! was released on region 2 dvd by network in 2006 as an extra in a box-set release of the beiderbecke trilogy. the moscow jewish film festival is an annual international film festival, which aims to gather in the program features, documentaries, shorts and animated films on

upham as the gesture that was to accompany the american pledge of allegiance, which had been written by francis bellamy. it was also known as the \"flag salute\" during the period when it was used with the pledge of allegiance. bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. both the pledge and its salute originated in 1892. later, during the 1920s and 1930s, italian fascists and nazi germans adopted a salute which was very similar, erroneously attributed to the roman salute, a gesture that was popularly believed to have been used in ancient rome. this resulted in controversy over the use of the bellamy salute in the united states. it was officially replaced by the hand-over-heart salute when congress amended the flag code on december 22, 1942. the inventor of the bellamy salute was james b. upham, junior partner and editor of the youth\\'s companion. bellamy recalled that upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said, \"now up there is the flag; i come to salute; as i say \"i pledge allegiance to my flag,\" i stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while i say the stirring words that follow.\" the bellamy salute was first demonstrated on october 12, 1892, according to bellamy\\'s published instructions for the \"national school celebration of columbus day\": at a signal from the principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the flag. another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute – right hand lifted, palm downward, to align with the forehead and close to it. standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, \"i pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" at the words, \"to my flag,\" the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side.in the 1920s, italian fascists adopted what has been called the roman salute to symbolize their claim to have revitalized italy on the model of ancient rome. a similar ritual was adopted by the german nazis, creating the nazi salute. controversy grew in the united states on the use of the bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes. school boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity. there was a counter-backlash from the united states flag association and the daughters of the american revolution, who felt it inappropriate for americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture. from 1939 until the attack on pearl harbor, detractors of americans who argued against intervention in world war ii produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those americans\\' reputations. among the anti-interventionist americans was aviation pioneer charles lindbergh. the pictures of him appearing to do the nazi salute are actually pictures of him using the bellamy salute. in his pulitzer prize-winning biography lindbergh (1998), author a. scott berg explains that interventionist propagandists would photograph lindbergh and other isolationists using this salute from an angle that left out the american flag, so it would be indistinguishable to observers from the nazi salute. on june 22, 1942, at the urging of the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars, congress passed public law 77-623, which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. this included the use of a palm-out salute, specifically that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words \\'to the flag\\' and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.\" congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. congress later amended the code on december 22, 1942, when it passed public law 77-829, stating among other changes, that the pledge \"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.\" the 1971–72 season was the 48th season in the existence of aek athens f.c. and the 13th consecutive season in the top flight of greek football. they competed in the alpha ethniki, the greek cup and the european cup. the season began on 29 august 1971 and finished on 11 june 1972. after the distinctions of the previous years, aek seemed to operate in a \"frantic tempo\", until this season, which was the passing to a declining period for the team. the team\\'s roster was constantly renewed as a generation of players left, passing the torch to the next one. the new generation was consisted of great and talented players, however the club was not ready to claim a leading role in the league. aek participated in the european cup. the draw was tough for aek, as from the very first round faced one of the greastest european clubs over time, the great internazionale of ivano bordon, giacinto facchetti and sandro mazzola. the first match at san siro in front of almost 80,000 spectators, aek managed to take the lead at the 14th minute with pomonis, but inter\\'s superiority was obvious and after equalizing 5 minutes later, they finished the first half leading by 3–1. the second half turned out to be a standard procedure with inter raising the score to 4–1 and likewise the few chances of aek qualifying disappeared. in the rematch at the crowded aek stadium no one expected what was about to happen. everything started wrong for the yellow-blacks, as they were left behind the score at the 17th minute with a goal by mazzola. bertini\\'s dismissal two minutes later and stankovic\\'s offensive style, brought aek in taking the lead at the half time with ventouris and papaioannou, while also having two shoots hit the post. the italians, wanting if nothing else not to lose, chased the goal and equalized with boninsegna at the 76th minute. the players of aek, realizing that the qualification was lost definitively, sought the victory and achieved it with a goal by nikolaidis at the 89th minute, that made the final 3–2. one of the greatest victories for the then \"poor\" greek football and the first great european night for aek. in the league they finished third with 6 points from the top. this season was one of the worst for the club\\'s history for the greek cup. a very important year for the development of the tournament, as the amateur teams of the local legal associations cease to participate and only the teams of the national divisions could participate. the ties of the first round competed again according to geographical criteria, while from the second round onwards the draw was free. aek easily overcame pao rouf in the first round and kozani in the second round, but in the round of 16 they faced lamia, who to everyone\\'s surprise, eliminated them with 1–0 at the extra time. note: the players are the ones that have been announced by the aek athens\\' press release. no edits should be made unless a player arrival or exit is announced. updated 30 june 1972,

critic scott yanow as \"the definitive swing pianist\", wilson had a sophisticated, elegant style. his work was featured on the records of many of the biggest names in jazz, including louis armstrong, lena horne, benny goodman, billie holiday, and ella fitzgerald. with goodman, he was one of the first black musicians to appear prominently with white musicians. in addition to his extensive work as a sideman, wilson also led his own groups and recording sessions from the late 1920s to the 1980s. wilson was born in austin, texas. he studied piano and violin at tuskegee institute in tuskegee, alabama. after working in speed webb\\'s band, with louis armstrong, and also understudying earl hines in hines\\'s grand terrace cafe orchestra, wilson joined benny carter\\'s chocolate dandies in 1933. in 1935, he joined the benny goodman trio (which consisted of goodman, wilson and drummer gene krupa, later expanded to the benny goodman quartet with the addition of lionel hampton). the trio performed during the big band\\'s intermissions. by joining the trio, wilson became one of the first black musicians to perform prominently in a racially integrated group. jazz producer and writer john hammond was instrumental in getting wilson a contract with brunswick, starting in 1935, to record hot swing arrangements of the popular songs of the day, with the growing jukebox trade in mind. he recorded hit records with singers such as lena horne, helen ward and billie holiday. during these years, he also took part in many sessions with swing musicians such as lester young, roy eldridge, charlie shavers, red norvo, buck clayton, and ben webster. from 1936 to 1942, he recorded for brunswick records and columbia records. in the 1950s he recorded on verve records. wilson formed his own short-lived big band in 1939, then led a sextet at café society from 1940 to 1944. he was dubbed the \"marxist mozart\" by howard \"stretch\" johnson due to his support for left-wing causes: he performed in benefit concerts for the new masses journal and for russian war relief, and he chaired the artists\\' committee to elect benjamin j. davis (a new york city council member running on the communist party usa ballot line). in the 1950s, wilson taught at the juilliard school. wilson can be seen appearing as himself in the motion pictures hollywood hotel (1937) and the benny goodman story (1955). he also worked as music director for the dick cavett show. wilson lived quietly in suburban hillsdale, new jersey. he was married three times, including to the songwriter irene kitchings. he performed as a soloist and with pickup groups until the final years of his life, including leading a trio with his sons theodore wilson on bass and steven wilson on drums. in 1979, wilson was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from berklee college of music. wilson died of stomach cancer in new britain, connecticut, on july 31, 1986, aged 73. he is buried at fairview cemetery in new britain. in

an egyptian artist and muralist based in luxor, egypt. awad is an egyptian artist and is also known for his public murals in cairo and luxor, egypt. he is well known for his murals created on mohamed mahmoud street in cairo, egypt in 2012 during the egyptian revolution, which took media attention. his public murals and paintings encompass the history, dignity and charisma of the egyptian people. he has worked internationally, in both solo exhibitions for his oil paintings and outdoor public murals. awad began his collegiate studies at south valley university, faculty of fine arts in luxor, egypt and graduated in 2004 with a bachelor of arts. afterwards, he began his masters studies at helwan university, college of fine arts in zamalek, egypt, while at the same time serving as an assistant lecturer for south valley university, faculty of fine arts in luxor egypt. during these years, awad spent time between both universities and graduated with a master of arts in 2012. currently, he is a phd candidate and serves as an assistant lecturer in the department of mural painting, for the faculty of fine arts, at south valley university in luxor, egypt. his murals and public art became well known in late 2011 and early 2012 after he took a break from teaching to paint a mural in cairo, in this moment the port said massacre unfolded which changed the course of his plans and shifted his mural into a memorial mural. what was meant to only be a short period of time in cairo became a much longer time for awad as he continued to paint new murals on mohamed mahmoud street in cairo. awad\\'s phd dissertation working title is, \"artistic vision inspired by the murals of war and peace in ancient egyptian art\" and is expected to be released in 2019. in regards to his murals, alaa chooses to paint with a brush and uses acrylic paints rather than using stencils and spray paints. his intricate paintings can sometimes take up to a week to complete, not only because of the materials he uses, but because of the complexity of his designs. awad paints in a neo-pharonic style, a style that harkens back to ancient egypt. his usage of the neo-pharonic style is meant to draw attention back to the rich, old egyptian traditions. this style aims to remind the egyptian people of their heritage and past, a reminder to stay true to their egyptian identity. his murals are typically multifaceted and multi-layered with each telling a different story. beyond the aforementioned unique style of painting, using a neo-pharaonic style aims to return the prominence of public murals in egypt. public murals have played a significant role in egyptian villages in the past, when each village had their own muralist. these muralists would essentially be storytellers of the village and would depict important events or celebrations through traditional imagery and symbolism. many of these same images can be seen in awad\\'s artwork today as he is inspired from the famous works of art from ancient egypt that may be seen in temples and museums. alaa awad is also inspired by other ancient egyptian intangible heritage forms still found in upper egypt such as tahtib (egyptian arabic: تحطيب taḥṭīb), el mormah and the daily life of the west bank in luxor, egypt. alaa awad\\'s public murals were created in cairo during the egyptian revolution and were painted on significant walls including temporary wall-like roadblock, built to keep protesters away from government buildings. in total, eight walls and seven roadblocks were constructed to keep protesters from tahrir square away from the ministry of the interior, ministry of justice, and parliament house. the paintings along mohamed mahmoud street reflect the juxtaposition between the ruling power and how their style of leadership has fueled the resistance. a major difference between awad\\'s public murals and the other street art is that awad\\'s art is much more subtle because of the neo-pharonic style of his works. while his works will oftentimes directly tie to a social issue, such as gas tank shortages or women\\'s rights, an underlying theme is that egyptians as a whole must remember their past culture and history stating that \"we can\\'t know our future if we forget our past.\" awad himself has indicated his own political beliefs stating that \"i don\\'t see any change in egypt\\'s politics, inside or out. i just see that the muslim brotherhood has captured the government. they want to change everything according to their own style, to make everything muslim brotherhood. they forget to improve things for the public. they have forgotten the people.\" the victory mosaic was designed by awad in luxor, egypt and was constructed with a team under the direction of awad. the team consisted of students and instructors from south valley university, faculty of fine arts, department of mural painting. it was inspired from the battle scenes found in ancient egyptian site habu temple. the material used to construct the mosaic was mosaic and glass. the approximate size is 6 x 4.8 meters. it was installed in late november 2017 on the sports hall building of south valley university campus in qena, egypt. the mosaic took one year to complete. marching women is a mural which consists of two main components, \"women in the funeral march\" and \"women climb the ladder\". this work is based on an original image in the ramesseum temple in west bank of luxor, a photo of engraved battle scenes on the ramesseum\\'s first pylon, thebes. the ramesseum has some of the egyptian world\\'s oldest surviving pylons. a pylon, or monumental portal to an ancient egyptian temple, usually consists of two massive upward tapering walls flanking and perpendicular to the temples entrance. awad changed it, his painting made women instead of men apparent to the viewer. this work shows the strong role that women played in society in the past of egypt and today. and we can see his meaning in the women\\'s hands—they have papyrus in their hands, this communicates the meaning of knowledge . this work, women climbing the ladder, was based on a scene located at the ramesseum temple in luxor, egypt. by placing this ancient image in a more modern context it demonstrates how instrumental women were in the past and also in the present. awad painted this piece to represent the role of women and stated the influence of the battle of kadesh in which it is located. in this court are well preserved scenes from the battle of kadesh. ramesses ii dashes into battle (lower row). he is depicted larger than his men, and the enemy, mostly dead and wounded, lie in heaps on the ground. the fortress of kadesh, surrounded by a moat, divides a group of the enemy from the battlefield. these men, far from preparing themselves for battle, are lending a hand to their drowning companions. though this mural has been considered by some as a pretentious interpretation, there is no doubt that the complexity of the composition shows development and sophistication. the individual figures, however, indicate marked deterioration from the expressive detail of the murals of seti i\\'s mortuary temple. egypt has a long history and its own traditions. this again highlights awad bringing social issues into the limelight while also reinforcing that egypt must return to its roots to move ahead. on mohamed mahmoud street is an extensive image of mural paintings inspired by ancient egyptian history, painted by awad in 2012. \"the myth of human destruction in ancient egypt\" with hieroglyphic written by amir fouad. in fact, however, history as cultural and social memory could not be more alive in the egyptian revolution and its aftermath. the egyptian revolution has reinvigorated history on the street in a way that has the capacity to produce change in society. the most intangible evidence of this is in the street murals of mohammad mahmoud street, which incorporated egyptian art in a way that endows both ancient and modern history with positive meanings. this image was expanded upon by awad by painting a series of hostesses, or \"ladies-in-waiting,\" which was meant to \"portray a centuries\" old feminine wisdom with a welcoming smile. this image shows the kindness of the hostess, representing the people, juxtaposed. the position of this figures inspire by the position of the figures unfinished in tomb of ramose. all night it is morning by andy young, november 2014 soft force: women in egypt\\'s islamic awakening by ellen anne mclarney

association (ibga) (in japanese) was established in 1998 as a disabled sports entity to organize, acknowledge and support international blind golf (visually impaired and blind golf) tournaments. as of 2014, it has around 500 registered golfers. in 1996, haruhisa handa who was the founder of japanese blind golf association appealed to blind golf associations around the world to set up a governing organization. in 1997, the world blind golfers conference was held in perth, australia, where representatives from six countries participated to propose the articles of association and handicap system. in 1998, the proposal was resolved at a meeting held during the 5th blind golf world championship in florida, us, so that a global governing organization could be established. handa was elected as the first president, and david blyth from australia became the first chairman (responsible in administration). there were eight organizations that took part in the world blind golfers’ conference held in 1997 from 6 countries; japan, united states, canada, australia, ireland, england, scotland and northern ireland. as of 2014, international blind golf association has 18 member organizations from 16 countries including 4 associate organizations from 4 countries. notes \"the hunger strike\" is a second-season episode of the adult swim animated television series the boondocks. it was set to premiere on january 7, 2008, between \"the story of thugnificent\" and \"attack of the killer kung-fu wolf bitch\", but did not air in the united states until may 29, 2020. in canada, the episode was aired on march 16, 2008, on the network teletoon at night, with a disclaimer stating that \"the views in this program do not reflect that of teletoon canada or its parent companies\". the episode also aired globally elsewhere, and appeared on netflix streaming in canada, as well as on hbo max in the united states shortly before its tv premiere. according to aaron mcgruder on an introduction video for the episode found on the dvd set, this episode was originally set to be titled \"bet sucks\". at the headquarters of bet, fictional president debra leevil (a parody of bet holdings ceo debra l. lee with a personality resembling dr. evil from the austin powers films) presides over a board meeting to discuss the network\\'s strategy for destroying black people. the issue of huey freeman is brought up, as he is shown on cnn giving a press conference stating that he is on a hunger strike and that he will not eat until there is a public apology for creating bet, the network is shut down, and all the executive board members commit seppuku. huey joins forces with the charismatic rev. rollo goodlove (voiced by rapper/singer cee-lo), who adds a flashy image to the fight against bet by lobbying for a boycott of the network. huey initially believes this to be a good idea, as a concert organized by goodlove (and featuring his band) draws widespread attention and sparks a widespread boycott. however, huey gradually discovers that goodlove is primarily interested in drawing media attention to himself through shameless merchandising, self-promotion, and outrageous behavior. goodlove justifies his tactics by explaining that in order to reach the black community, he has to present its members with something they can relate to. leevil and the bet board eventually see a news broadcast in which uncle ruckus expresses his support of bet and its ability to ruin the minds of young black people. taking inspiration from his words, they offer goodlove a sitcom on the network; he accepts, betraying huey and causing the boycott to fall apart. huey ends his hunger strike and asks his grandfather robert, \"what do you do when you can\\'t do nothing, but there\\'s nothing you can do?\" \"you do what you can,\" robert says. there have been rumors that this and a second episode (\"the uncle ruckus reality show\") were initially banned from airing in the u.s. due to threatened litigation from bet. the episodes are said to specifically attack reggie hudlin, bet\\'s president of entertainment from 2005 to 2008, and debra l. lee, president and chief executive officer of bet holdings (parent company of bet). lee is portrayed as deborah leevil, a parody of the character dr. evil from the austin powers movies, and hudlin is portrayed as wedgie rudlin, a \"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his ivy league education.\" however, a cartoon network representative stated that bet had not contacted cartoon network regarding the episodes. sony pictures television, which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter. ironically, hudlin was credited as an executive producer for the first two seasons of the boondocks, though this was only a contractual obligation; hudlin had no involvement with the show since the first pilot was rejected by fox. during the episode, the character deborah leevil relates the mission of bet within the boondocks universe, stating: our leader bob johnson had a dream, a dream creating a network that would accomplish what hundreds of years of slavery, jim crow and malt liquor couldn\\'t – the destruction of black people! on the dvd release of the second season, mcgruder states \"i was looking for changes and improvements, and i didn\\'t see any.\" referring to bet\\'s programming. he decided to show his frustration using satire in the boondocks, reasoning \"i didn\\'t see them. so i said, ok, it\\'s fair game.\" bongoulou is a village in the bassar prefecture in

problem of natural language processing, which concerns the automatic identification of the senses of a word (i.e. meanings). given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of word-sense disambiguation (wsd), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the ambiguity of words in context. the output of a word-sense induction algorithm is a clustering of contexts in which the target word occurs or a clustering of words related to the target word. three main methods have been proposed in the literature: the underlying hypothesis of this approach is that, words are semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, with in similar context windows, or in similar syntactic contexts. each occurrence of a target word in a corpus is represented as a context vector. these context vectors can be either first-order vectors, which directly represent the context at hand, or second-order vectors, i.e., the contexts of the target word are similar if their words tend to co-occur together. the vectors are then clustered into groups, each identifying a sense of the target word. a well-known approach to context clustering is the context-group discrimination algorithm based on large matrix computation methods. word clustering is a different approach to the induction of word senses. it consists of clustering words, which are semantically similar and can thus bear a specific meaning. lin’s algorithm is a prototypical example of word clustering, which is based on syntactic dependency statistics, which occur in a corpus to produce sets of words for each discovered sense of a target word. the clustering by committee (cbc) also uses syntactic contexts, but exploits a similarity matrix to encode the similarities between words and relies on the notion of committees to output different senses of the word of interest. these approaches are hard to obtain on a large scale for many domain and languages. the main hypothesis of co-occurrence graphs assumes that the semantics of a word can be represented by means of a co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. these approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical or collocational relations. hyperlex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters. to deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely curvature clustering, squares, triangles and diamonds (squat++), and balanced maximum spanning tree clustering (b-mst). the patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. a randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices is chinese whispers. by applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks. laguna\\'s 1st congressional district is one of the six congressional districts of the philippines in the province of laguna, formerly la laguna. it has been represented in the house of representatives of the philippines since 1916 and earlier in the philippine assembly from 1907 to 1916. the 1st district of laguna, lone district of san pedro city is currently represented in the 19th congress by maria rene ann lourdes g. matibag of the pdp-laban (pdplbn). s.a.m.e., an acronym for società accomandita motori endotermici, is an italian agricultural machinery manufacturer. the company was founded in 1942 in treviglio (bergamo), italy, by the brothers francesco and eugenio cassani. same main products are tractors and front loaders. the company is now part of the sdf group. in 1927, the brothers francesco and eugenio cassani designed and built the cassani 40cv agricultural tractor. this was powered by a diesel engine, a form of propulsion that had begun to be used in industrial, military and rail vehicle applications since the 1920s. the engine was a two stroke horizontal two-cylinder unit with a capacity of 12,723 cm3 producing forty horsepower at 550 rpm, with wick ignition, a compressed air starter system with pressurised air tank air, 4 speeds (3 fwd and 1 rev) and a top speed of 15 km/h. this tractor was sold at a price of 28,000 lire. the tractor designed by cassani was sold under license by officine gaetano barbieri in castelmaggiore. established in 1942, the newly formed company same initially manufactured petrol and diesel engines for civil and industrial applications such as winches, cranes, ploughs and fire-fighting pumps. in 1946, same introduced its first motor mower models, powered by an 8 hp petrol engine. at the milan trade fair in 1946, same presented its first 3-wheeled petrol-powered motor mower, which could also be attached to other agricultural machinery and implements. this was the company\\'s first “universal tractor”, catering for the needs of the market in the years immediately following the second world war. the same 3r/10, a universal small tractor powered by a single cylinder 10 hp petrol engine, was presented in 1948. this machine had two driving wheels and a single steering wheel, variable track and reversible drive. the tractor was awarded the gold medal by the turin agricultural academy. on 24 october 1948, the “giornale dell’agricoltura” described it as “a gem of italian industry”. production of the brand\\'s petrol powered models began in 1950, with the introduction of the 10 hp same 4r/10 and the 20 hp 4r/20. 1952 saw the launch of the da 25, the first mass-produced modern tractor with all-wheel drive, powered by a 25 hp, 2280 cm3 two cylinder diesel engine, with a 7 speed transmission and a top speed of 24.3 km/h. the name da stood for diesel aria (diesel air), as the engine was air-cooled, in keeping with same traditions. mass production of four-wheel drive tractors, with original dual traction system, already conceived in 1928, begins. the new da 30 dt was launched in 1957. offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the da 25. during this period, same also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and reversible ploughs), spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper trailers, irrigation pumps and auger drills. the first da 30 dt models were painted orange with green wheels, while towards the end of the 1950s. the colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine. the same 240 was launched in 1958. this was known as the \\'intelligent tractor\\', as it was equipped as standard with the innovative s.a.c. (\\'stazione automatica di controllo\\' - \\'automatic control station\\') lower hitch arm draft control system conceived by same, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years. this tractor was powered by a 42 hp two cylinder unit, with 6 forward speeds, one reverse speed and a top speed of 28.9 km/h. 1961 was the year of the same puledro and the samecar, a tractor which, after working the land, could then also be used to transport produce in its load bay. a new range of 6 and 8 cylinder engines was also developed during this period. at the verona expo in 1965, same presented its new v engines and the italia v, atlanta, sametto v and 450 v tractors. another major development was the change from traditional rounded cowls to a more modern, boxy design. the centauro range, consisting of three different models, was launched in 1965. these tractors were powered by a 3500 cm3 v4 engine producing 55 hp, with 8 forward speeds, 4 reverse speeds and a top speed of 34.8 km/h. the 1972 corsaro 70 and saturno 80 tractors were presented in 1972. in 1973, same bought lamborghini trattori s.p.a. from ferruccio lamborghini, in its own range. in 1979, same acquired the swiss hürlimann traktoren brand and changed its name to gruppo slh (same+lamborghini+hürlimann), becoming the second largest tractor producer in italy and a leading manufacturer on a global scale. the same explorer family, which was to become one of the most successful product ranges in the history of the company, was launched in 1983. this was the first italian-built tractor with a top speed of 40 km/h, and the only tractor with 4-wheel braking. the technology offered by gruppo slh at the end of the 1980s also included the original twin vision video camera rear view system. same engine technology also took a major step forward, with electronically controlled fuel injection available for the entire 1000 series. in 1991, the electronic powershift transmission, designed specifically for high power applications, was launched together with the titan range, while the frutteto ii introduced a family of tractors dedicated for use in fruit orchards and vineyards. in 1995, gruppo slh acquired the agricultural machinery division of klöckner-humboldt-deutz, giving rise to the same deutz-fahr group. in 1999, same introduced the galileo self-levelling system in the rubin 200 tractor range. this system, developed to facilitate working on gradients, won the golden tractor for design millennium edition award in 2000. 2007 marked the 80th anniversary of the first tractor built by francesco and eugenio - the cassani 40cv. on 12 october 2012, same celebrated its 70th birthday at its historical headquarters in treviglio. to mark the occasion, the italian brand announced a spate of new investments and new models for the future, chief among which the \"virtus\" (100-110-120-130 hp) tractor family, designed by italdesign giugiaro. cassani: same: same tractors: numerous 1:32 and

earlier faces of death which included fake deaths and reenactments, traces consists mostly of actual footage depicting death and injury, and consists also of public domain footage from other films. it was written and narrated by damon fox. since its release, traces of death has been followed by four sequels. the first sequel, traces of death ii, was released in june 1994. this was followed by traces of death iii in december 1994, traces of death iv: resurrected in 1996 and traces of death v: back in action in april 2000. in the first two films of the series, damon fox was the narrator. darrin ramage, who would later become the founder of brain damage films, would become the host for the third, fourth and fifth volumes. unlike faces of death, the footage throughout the entire films are real and are not staged or reenacted. starting with traces of death ii, scenes were accompanied by background music from death metal and grindcore bands. also contained in the series, especially in the first one, is footage of step-by-step autopsy procedures, which are shown from a coroner\\'s point of view. most of the other footage is recognizably notable. among the footage samples seen on traces of death and in the sequels that followed are listed below. the first film of the series also contains allegedly staged footage from savage man savage beast, where a tourist, pit dernitz supposedly gets mauled and eaten by african lions. other scenes that feature animals include undated footage of a pig experiment by military scientists at the burn center in fort sam houston (derived from a 1987 mondo film entitled true gore), an animal control officer, florence crowell being attacked by a pit bull in los angeles, california in 1987, and a black bear getting shocked off a utility pole in albuquerque, new mexico in 1989. the first two films both contain scenes of sex reassignment surgery, which is featured in the 1974 mondo film shocking asia. some autopsy footages were taken from the 1961 u.s. army training film basic autopsy procedure. also included is an interview with james vance, who had attempted suicide with a shotgun at a church playground in sparks, nevada (taken from the documentary dream deceivers). the only known footage showing evidence of ilse koch is included as well. there is one unusual piece of footage taken at a monster truck show in baltimore, maryland, on march 23, 1992. what makes this footage so unusual is that the robot transformer at the show malfunctioned. a large rod from the malfunctioning robot went into the actor of the alien suit\\'s chest, and exploded. another notable air show crash in the film took place in plainview, texas, on september 11, 1983, where the pilot lost both his plane\\'s wings in mid-air and plummeted into the field below. there are many other various plane crashes and race car crashes during the middle and towards the end of the film. the third edition starts with crime scenes in urban american cities such as new york city, ranging from murders to traffic crashes. these pieces look as if taken from the \\'60s and \\'70s. this volume also shows what it is like to survive an attack, as in a 1991 press conference of frank tempest, an english man disfigured in the face when he was attacked by two pit bulls. also included is graphic content of gang violence in russia, various motocross and amateur race car crashes, and cockfighting held in the philippines. another piece of notable footage in the fourth volume is a moose killing a man in anchorage, alaska on january 9, 1995. towards the start of the film graphic photographs of birth defects are shown. there is also footage of traffic crashes from the graphic driving education film, signal 30. the last volume starts with three police chases. the first was in los angeles in june 1996. the second was also in los angeles, but it took place in june 1995. the third took place in whittier, california in september 1995. all were televised live by helicopter pilot zoey tur. the music clearance were provided by subtempeco muzik (pseudonymously credited as t.o.d.), which derived from various film soundtracks. later in traces of death 3, the first soundtrack album was released on cd.the soundtrack for the first installment were tracks by j.r. bookwalter from the 1989 film robot ninja. the soundtrack for traces of death iii was released on cd by relapse records in 1995. the music featured in the film include: in 2003, a box set of the entire series was released on dvd by brain damage films. the original traces of death has run into controversy worldwide due to its graphic content. in 1997, amy hochberg, a woman living in coaldale, pennsylvania rented the film from a video store and was so disgusted by the film\\'s content that she considered keeping the tape as to avoid children from procuring it from the store. she also contacted multiple animal rights groups after witnessing a scene in the film wherein a pig is experimented on with a blowtorch. she also lodged a complaint with the video store she had rented it from, as she thought the film was simply \"911 calls with a little more\". in 2003, a dvd boxset of the film and its sequels were confiscated by the australian customs and border protection service, after being deemed to \"contravene regulation 4a(1a)(a) of the customs (prohibited imports) regulations.\" in 2005, the british board of film classification refused to give the first film an age certificate, effectively banning it. the bbfc considered the film to have \"no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the images shown\", while also suggesting that the film could potentially breach uk law under the obscene publications act. the hybrid elm cultivar ulmus × hollandica \\'fastigiata\\' was first listed and described as ulmus glabra fastigiata, a narrow-crowned elm with large smooth leaves, by petzold and kirchner in arboretum muscaviense (1864). c. berndt of the berndt nursery, zirlau, schweidnitz, described an elm of the same name in mitteilungen der deutschen dendrologischen gesellschaft (1915, including a photograph), that he had received in 1903 \"from a renowned nursery in holstein\" as ulmus montana fastigiata macrophylla. a tree of that name had been listed by dieck in 1885 without description. berndt reported that his u. glabra fastigiata was \"easy to confuse with u. montana superba\", a tree \"known in the magdeburg region as ulmus praestans\", a statement confirming that, like that cultivar, his tree was a form of u. × hollandica. karl gustav hartwig who received specimens of u. praestans from kiessling of the magdeburg city nursery in 1908, concluded (1912) that u. glabra fastigiata kirchner was indistinguishable in leaf or habit from u. praestans. an u. campestris glabra fastigiata arb. musc. [ = kirchner] was distributed by the hesse nursery, weener, germany, in the 1930s, where it was listed separately from u. praestans. the späth nursery of berlin marketed an u. montana fastigiata glabra in the 1890s and early 1900s. bean (1925) listed an u. glabra \\'fastigiata stricta\\' (1925). not to be confused with exeter elm, loudon\\'s u. montana fastigiata (1838) and elwes and henry\\'s u. montana var. fastigiata (1913). kirchner\\'s ulmus glabra fastigiata was narrow-crowned, with large smoothish leaves of firmer texture than his ulmus glabra mill.. berndt\\'s ulmus glabra fastigiata was a tree of tight narrow pyramidal growth, the leaf being dark, acuminate, irregularly veined, and often wider at the top than lower down. berndt reported the tree as \"less vigorous than ulmus montana superba\" [ = u. praestans]. ulmus glabra fastigiata was cultivated in silesia by the berndt nursery, zirlau, schweidnitz, in the early 20th century. berndt reported that, though stocked in only a few nurseries, it was praised at the 20th century exhibition in breslau. no specimens are known to survive. the trio competition in aerobic gymnastics at the 2001 world games in akita was played from 17 to 18 august. the aerobic gymnastics competition took place at akita city gymnasium. a total of 8 teams entered the competition. only final was held. parornix conspicuella is a moth of the family gracillariidae. it is known from québec, canada, and pennsylvania, maine, michigan and vermont in the united states. the larvae feed on betula nigra. they mine the leaves of their host plant. this article relating to moths in genus parornix is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it. colonel sir david harris kcmg (12 july 1852 - 23 september 1942) was a soldier, diamond magnate, and legislator. he was born in london, england, and emigrated to the colony of natal in 1871. he later traveled 950 km from durban to kimberley where he began working as a prospector. within two years, he was wealthy and had made the acquaintance of cecil rhodes. he joined the du toit\\'s pan horse regiment in 1876 fought in the gaika-galeka war (part of the xhosa wars in the eastern cape. he also fought in other campaigns and distinguished himself in the langeberg rebellion (1896-97). he served in the home guard during the siege of kimberley. in 1897, he joined the parliament of the cape of good hope on the death of barney barnato. he held the seat for 32 years. in 1897, he also became a director of de beers consolidated mines, an office he held until 1931. harris married his wife, rosa gabriel, in 1873, in the first jewish wedding to take place in kimberley. jan hejduk (born 13 february 1947) is a czechoslovak boxer. he competed in the men\\'s middleweight event at the 1968 summer olympics. this biographical article related to a czech boxer is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it. coleochaete is a genus of parenchymatous charophyte green algae in the order coleochaetales. they are haploid, reproduce both sexually and asexually, and have true multicellular organisation, with plasmodesmata communicating between adjacent cells. the plants form flat, sprawling discs on solid surfaces in freshwater streams worldwide, usually as epiphytes on aquatic plants or growing on the surface of stones. they are seen as one of two most probable sister groups to land plant species, the second candidate group being the characeae. the issue is still not resolved. as they show some of the earliest and simplest features of multicellular plant growth, they are ideal model organisms in the field of synthetic biology.[citation needed] they are easy to culture and techniques that have been used to study arabidopsis thaliana are now being applied to coleochaete. coleochaete has a sterile jacket of cells that surround the gametangia and zygotes that are protected by a layer of sterile cells after fertilization. however, unlike land plants, coleochaete has zygotic meiosis, meiosis taking place directly in the zygote and not in diploid cells resulting from mitotic division of the zygote. this green algae-related article is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it.green green grass by the river is a 1992 taiwanese television drama series based on chiung yao\\'s novel of the same name. the series was filmed in yangzhou and nanjing, china. xiao cao is a young orphan living with her cruel aunt and uncle. she has a sisterly bond with her neighbour, qing qing, who is being forced into a marriage with a much older man by her older brother. desperate to escape their unfortunate circumstances, the two girls manage to run away together on the day of qing qing\\'s wedding. during their escape they coincidentally meet he shiwei, a young university student who is also running away from his family due to an arranged marriage. after a few initial misunderstandings the three decide to travel together. however, things become complicated when they encounter the fu family, and the family matriarch mistakes he shiwei for her son, fu yuankai, who died 10 years ago. this article related to taiwanese television is a stub. you can help wikipedia by expanding it.'"
